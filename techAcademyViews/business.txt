We have offers (monthly)

$497 per seminar -----    2,012 sales 
$34,997 Premium ------       30 sales 


10 Million Men   (55+)
10 Million Women (55+)


Their will be online and in-person classes. Monthly classes based on certain topics that will be rotated 
every year, plus added content about things that are more complicated. 


The Logic is pretty simple 
If FREE -> We send them to a specific sales page that leads them directly to registration, which will create
them a profile that will give their accout thing with "Premium:false", which make some of the content hidden 
and will ask them if they want to upgrade. 

if PAID -> paid sales page -> stripe link -> registration page with create user with "premium:true" does not 
show the things, they cannot upgrade. 

What needs to be figured out, how the heck do we get them
