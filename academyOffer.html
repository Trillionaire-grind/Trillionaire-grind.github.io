        <h2>Discover the New…</h2>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;"0>"Tech Mastery For Seniors Academy"</h1>
    <blockquote style="font-size: 20px;">
      “Information is the oxygen of the modern age. It seeps through the walls topped by barbed wire, it wafts across the electrified borders”<br>
      <strong>-Ronald Reagan</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>
      Reagan said this is in the 80s...<br>
      Almost two decade before the internet became mainstream<br><br>

      Now in 2025, the internet has improved significantly and so has our access to information<br><br>

      For example, everyday YouTube gains 200,000 hours of information<br>
      It would take you 22 years, just to learn 1 day’s worth of content on YouTube…<br><br>

      Although it's great that we have access to so much information, <br>
      there’s two MASSIVE problems…<br><br>

      Before I reveal them, let me ask you a few questions…<br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you agree that the world is changing faster than before?</li>
        <li>Do you agree that technology is affecting every part of modern life?</li>
        <li>Do you agree that your grandchildren are always using it</li>
        <li>Do you agree that technology is useful?</li>
      </ul>

      If you answered yes then we are on the same page, and you must continue reading...<br><br>

      The two MASSIVE with this change is that...<br><br>

      First Problem: You struggle to use technology <br>
      Second problem: Your grandchildren use it… alot and they are influenced by EVERYONE except you…<br><br>

      That’s why we created the “Tech Mastery For Seniors Academy” where you will learn technology from a software engineer with nearly 20 years of experience with technology<br><br>

      You see, It’s not your fault that you are struggling. You weren’t raised with technology, and you retired before the mass adoption of technology, and you never had someone to actually teach you<br><br>

      You may be asking if I am the right teacher for you...and that's a great question<br><br>

      You can read some of the testimonials of people that I have helped in the world of tech<br><br>

      What people said about working with me:<br><br>

      “What a joy to meet Kepler Siguineau for training and tech support on smart devices. There is so much to learn, but he makes it easy and fun. With a wonderful personable demeanor, he is very easy to understand in learning the latest technology. Kepler stays up to date on the everchanging, expanding technology and brings it down to my level for comprehension. I highly recommend Kepler training and tech support.” - A happy student<br><br>

      The issue with not being able to use technology, is that you are being left behind<br>
      And because technology keeps taking over everything it's only going to get worse…<br><br>

      unless you decide to finally learn or you will have to rely on people…<br><br>

      And you’re not that type of person right? <br><br>

      You believe in being self-reliant <br>
      And if you want to continue being self-reliant...<br><br>

      you have to learn…<br><br>

      losing your self-reliance is only the first problem…and that's already a big problem<br>
      you have another terrible second problem...your grandchildren’s safety<br><br>

      You see, unlike you, they are spending a lot of time on the internet<br>
      Like 4-8 hours a day, everyday…<br><br>

      Being influenced by everyone, except you<br><br>

      Technology can be a tool for great....<br>
      and just like everthing else in life, anything that can be used for good, can be used for bad<br>
      and when it comes to technogy it can be detrimental…to your grandchildren and your family<br><br>

      In fact, according to “Children’s Hospital Association” (CHA) in 2021, 2 million teens attempted suicide and 20% of high school students say that they strongly consider suicide…<br><br>

      Do you want to know why this is happening?<br>
      unfortunately its not just one reason for that horrific stastic…<br><br>

      Your grandchildren are constantly being told they are not enough <br>
      and they are constantly bombarded by people that are “better” than them<br>
      People that are better looking...more successful...more popular <br><br>

      they end up comparing themselves to the highlights of people that they never met<br>
      which ends up making them feel like they are lacking and worthless...<br><br>

      When you went through your teens…you also went through the comparison game<br>
      Like all teens do…<br><br>

      As a teen you maybe compared yourself to a hundred teens in your town<br>
      As a teen your grandkids are comparing themselves to millions of other teens across the world...everyday<br><br>

      Not only are your grandchildren going through this issue...<br>
      there's a bigger problem that stems from it...who they go for advice<br><br>

      see right now, yes like this very moment your grandchildren are going through attacks to their self esteem<br><br>

      They are going to go on their phone to look for an ear to listen to them and reassure them of their self worth<br>
      that could be you, if you were comfortable with technology and had built a relationship with them online<br>
      you know...the place they live <br><br>
      Do you want to be with them? [yes] <br><br>
      ADD CTA HERE<br><br>

      if you haven't purchased yet and learned to master technology...<br><br>

      your grandchildren will instead go online to seek for an ear to listen to them, to receive advice <br><br>
      
      and they will receive both...however this is where the REAL danger is...<br>
      the majority of the people that are giving advice to your grandchildren are children themselves…<br><br>

      they have no life experience and they don't care about your grandchildren<br>
      that's a distater brewing

      Your grandchild is spending 4 hours a day on the website “Reddit", which has 70+ million people who visit that website daily<br><br>

      Reddit becomes their source of information and everyday help...

      The thing is... the majority of the people on Reddit are below the age of 20…<br>
      That means when something is going poorly in your grandchildrens’ lives, they are asking other children with no life experience for help<br><br>

      The blind leading the blind<br><br>

      There’s also a third MASSIVE PROBLEM with all of this…<br>
      Your grandchildren are being indoctrinated by the left<br><br>

      The internet is full of liberals that are promoting <br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Communism</li>
            <li>LGBT+</li>
            <li>Anti-american values</li>
        </ul>

      while vilifying conservatives that want to make sure that…<br>
      America stands tall for for freedom, democracy, and capitalism <br><br>

      As you can see...learning is technology not just about you,<br>
      Or just about protecting your grandchildren<br>
      It's also about the future of this country…<br><br>

      If you don’t learn, you will lose your self-reliance,<br>
      your grandchildren will suffer, and American values will disappear <br><br>

      Now that can all change, if you decide to learn to use technology<br><br>

      You can extend your ability to be self-reliant, gain the benefits of technology, be there for your children, and your country <br><br>

      It’s easier now than ever before…<br><br>

      <ul>
        <li>To stay connected with loved ones</li>
        <li>To learn new things </li>
        <li>To share your wisdom</li>
        <li>To run a business</li>
        <li>To create art</li>
        <li>To influence the youth</li>
      </ul> 
      ...if you are tech savvy<br><br>

      Think about it, with billions of hours of information on the internet,<br>
      You can learn ANYTHING you want and… you can FREE yourself from distance<br><br>

      If your grandchildren live across the country, with tech you can still be there for them without putting yourself in discomfort<br><br>

      You can talk to them everyday on the internet because that’s where they are…<br><br>

      If you wanted to do that before, you would have to change your plans and travel away which feels exhausting… <br><br>

      You can be there when they are feeling like they are not enough, to remind them that they are loved and they are enough <br><br>

      Nowadays most households have two working parents, this means that most children don’t have a parent to speak to…at home<br><br>

      They need a grandparent that is only one FaceTime call away<br><br>

      It’s not only your grandchildren, it's all of America’s grandchildren that are going through this…<br><br>

      You have a lot of wisdom, and we (me and all of America’s youth) need you to share it, without it, America will disappear<br><br>

      You can help fix this by joining the <br><strong>“Tech Mastery For Seniors Academy”</strong><br>
      An educational program built for you <br><br>

      You might think that technology is too hard<br><br>

      Well, technology is actually easy to use. It might be hard for you to believe that now because you are struggling, and that’s why you go to a teacher…<br><br>

      If you wanted to learn a new language, you wouldn't just magically learn on your own…<br>
      You would go to someone who has mastered the language and who is a good teacher to teach you, and that’s exactly what the academy is all about<br><br>

      Now you may think that you are too old and can’t learn like children can<br>
      Fortunately for you, you are wrong about that<br><br>

      You see, your age is actually a benefit. You have built a foundation of knowledge that young children have not…<br><br>

      Here’s the secret as to why it's so “easy” for children…<br>
      They don’t care about breaking stuff to get what they want<br><br>

      If your grandchild wants to watch YouTube, they will click on everything on the device until they either find YouTube or break it<br><br>

      As an adult, you don’t do that which is good… however it's also One of the reasons you struggle with learning technology… your fear of breaking things<br><br>

      At first its an intelligent thing, however it becomes crippling because you don’t know what to do next and you get stuck<br><br>

      A kid's brilliance comes from their experience of breaking the technology…<br>
      or from learning it from someone else…just like they learn new slangs<br><br>

      you don’t have to go through the breaking phase, and you don’t have to continue to struggle…<br><br>

      You must join the “Tech Mastery For Seniors Academy”<br><br>

      You see it's not your fault you struggled, how could you not if...<br><br>

      <ul>
        <li>You weren’t raised with technology</li>
        <li>You left the workplace before all of this technology</li>

      the total value  all the pieces of the program... $76,344<br><br>

      because we bundled it for you as the <br> <strong>"Tech Mastery For Seniors Academy"</strong> <br>you won’t have to pay the full $76,344…<br>
      you instead are getting a 50% discount which means you only pay $38,172…<br><br>

      not only are you saving $38,172, you are most importantly a lot of time because you you will gain 20 years of experience in only 12 months<br><br>

      ...and during those months you only have to invest a couple hours to learn...<br>
      That’s right, only a few hours a month… to master technology<br><br>

      PLUS you will receive some BONUSES<br>
      You will get the “No B.S Guide To Tech Mastery For Seniors” (Value of $497)<br>

      Would you pay $100,000 to save your grandchildrens’ lives? <br><br>
      That last question was completely rhetorical...their college fund alone will cost more than $100,000 anyways...<br><br>

      P.S.<br>
      Not knowing how to use technology today doesn’t just make life inconvenient...<br>
      it makes you invisible, you miss out on conversations, on opportunities, and worst of all…on your grandchildren’s world<br><br>

      While they’re being influenced by strangers on the internet, you’re stuck on the sidelines, unable to guide or protect them<br><br>

      Your independence fades, your connection weakens, and your voice is lost<br><br>

      That’s why we created the<br> <strong>“Tech Mastery For Seniors Academy,”</strong><br> a 12-month hybrid program that gives you access to…<br><br>

      in-person workshops, online seminars, weekly Q&As, unlimited recordings, and even your own weekday Always Human IT Help Desk…<br><br>

      a curated program that will have you master technology...<br><br>

      That’s $76,344 in real value, however because we bundle it for you... you are getting a 50% OFF discount <br>
      Istead of $76,344 you will pay only $38,172…plus you will get $2,494 in bonuses, and a full refund guarantee if you don’t absolutely love your first class<br><br>

      P.P.S.<br>
      You can’t afford to keep procrastinating. Yes, life is busy…<br>
      Yes it would be easier to just not learn...<br><br>

      However the consequences are so great that you can't afford to not learn<br>
      It's like burning your hand on your stove and you decide to do it again...<br><br>
      
      The only difference is that the consequences are worse than the blistering from a burned hand...<br><br>

      How long will you delay learning something that will protect your grandchildren, preserve your independence, and reconnect you to the modern world? <br><br>
      I have to be honest, I can't guarantee that you will be to actually protect them...you could learn all you need to...and you still don't do it<br><br>

      What I can guarantee is that you have a good fighting chance to protect those around you...<br>
      Yourself...You won't have to call someone to help you with something that is ridiciously simple<br><br>

      One decision today could change the next 20 years of your life...your grandchildren’s lives and your legacy…<br><br>

      
      You love your independence, right?<br>
      You love to learn, right?<br>
      you love your granchildren, right? <br><br>
      Do you want to protect your grandchildren?<br>
      Do you care about the future of America?<br><br>

      Then what are you waiting for?<br><br>

      There are only 12 spots available. Once they’re gone, they’re gone. You can choose to act today or regret it later<br>
