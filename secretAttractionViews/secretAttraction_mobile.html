        <strong>The Secret Attraction&nbsp;</strong><br>
        <strong>Between Mentor And Mentee</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:right;">Love at First Sight</p>
      <p>NYC 8 P.M.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In the office of Michael Katz (young CEO of New York's latest tech startup: “Tech &amp; Tech”), we find two men standing over a round table in the dark staring at a laptop screen.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Those two gentlemen were Michael himself and his co-founder and best friend Chris.</p>
      <p>They were going over this year's winner of WEM or "Women In Entrepreneurship Mentorship" program.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why were two men leading WEM?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>As Micheal climbed the ladder of success he experienced many trials and tribulations, internal and external battles, and being black in america. As climbed and stopped to look around he saw other black people. Although they were few, he could still see black in the pool of financial success in America. After his first lookout he also realised that in that pool of black excellence, there were nearly no women there. Women that reminded him of his mom. A single mother who worked hard to provide for her children. Who did not have access to the knowledge, mindset and environment to live a financially better life for themselves and their children.</p>
      <p>He knew that when he made it, he had to help. Four years ago they hit $1M in ARR (Annually Recurring Revenue - How much the company earns), they started WEM.</p>
      <p>In the four years they have had the mentorship, they have helped four black women grow from earning as low as $40,000 / year to over $3,000,000 / Year in their businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>After those four years they are now at $20M ARR with a new goal: to grow to $100M ARR in the next two years. They know for their business to grow their best chance was to have a physical presence in the world. That is what they set out to do. This year they are looking for a candidate that knows how to provide great customer experience in a brick and mortar.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>They were still looking for the usual, a candidate that is creative, resilient, and coachable. Most importantly they need someone that will benefit from their mentorship and who will help grow “Tech &amp; Tech”.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;“Chris, who is this year’s winner?” Michael asked Chris (he leads the WEM recruitment). “Her name is LaShana and she is much better than all of the candidates, the second I read her submission I knew she was the winner.”</p>
      <p>“Okay Chris, you’re hyping her up! Let's listen to her speech” and just like that Micheal presses play. On the screen he sees a woman exit the podium, followed by a beautiful woman walking towards the podium. Once she arrived at her destination the screen on the podium that displayed the speaker’s name changed.&nbsp; What was once "Diane" became "LaShana".&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The second Micheal saw the new name he quickly paused the video.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>He then looked at Chris and said "we have a problem"&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Chris, confused, asks him "what's the problem?"&nbsp;</p>
      <p>"She's beautiful!"</p>
      <p>"Whaaaat you find her attractive? How? Why? Since when?"</p>
      <p>“She's super my type. We can’t have her join the mentorship”</p>
      <p>Chris was certain Micheal wouldn't be attracted to her. He did not think she was ugly, he just thought she would not be Micheal’s type. She was a tomboy and he never showed interest in tomboys before. Micheal loves working with women, the caveat is that he only works with women that he doesn't find attractive. After having known each other for years, Mike has asked Chris to interview the mentees and to always make sure of two things:&nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>they are qualified for the internship</li>
        <li>He is not attracted to them</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In the past four years, Chris has been successful at fulfilling this request. This is the first time that he got it wrong. He was confused, he thought that he knew Mike’s type through and through. Chris knew that Mike had basic and sometimes bad taste. Chris’s wife Alexandra,&nbsp; in Chris’s eyes, is the most beautiful woman in the world. When they first started dating Chris wanted to brag, so he showed Michael a picture of Alexandria and asked “how hot is this woman?”. Expecting to hear a “she’s a 9” he instead heard Michael say “like a 6?“ He was stunned, was his friend blind? Did he just have terrible taste? He couldn't understand it at all! So he decided to let it go and just let him live his best life.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“What did you just say? No. That would be completely stupid, unfair, and we can’t do that. We already told her that she won, we also sent out rejection letters to all the other candidates and she completely stood out from the others. We’re not going to lose talent because you found this particular woman attractive. There’s probably ten women more beautiful than her messaging you right now.”</p>
      <p>Micheal paused and realised that Chris was right, they couldn't cancel the mentorship, and he realised Chris was wrong. There were no women more beautiful than LaShana texting him because LaShana wasn’t texting him.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Chris: "She slipped through because your attraction scale is out of whack."</p>
      <p>Micheal: "nah, she's beautiful. Well since you're going to mentor her, there’s nothing we have to worry about"&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Chris: "already defending your wife's honour I see." He said laughing.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Micheal: "Shut up, can you send her the email for the LDA meeting”</p>
      <p>What is a “<strong>LDA Meeting?</strong>”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong>
        <strong>L -unch</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>D -inner</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A -fter party</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Meeting</strong>
      </p>
      <p>“The lunch dinner after party was Chris' invention for their mentees. It starts with a light lunch followed by a three hour meeting, then a dinner with Michael, Chris and their mentee. It ends with an after party on the team that the mentee will work closely with (In LaShana’s case it's going to be the retail store development team). They do this with the mentees once a month. The goal is to provide them with undivided attention, answer their mentee’s questions, and grow creatively with the team.”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong>June 1st, LaShana has her first L.D.A. meeting.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>She is meeting with Chris. He warned her that the restaurant tends to be cold and that might want to dress warm. She chose a simple and cute outfit. A white long sleeve shirt, a light brown sweater with beige pants paired with a cute beige purse and a pair of black boots. In her purse she brought her essentials which included her success notebook. The notebook she uses to write anything and everything that could help her achieve her dreams.</p>
      <p>She walked into the restaurant 10 minutes early, as her motto was, "if you're on time then you’re 10 minutes late", she was surprised to see that Chris was already there with a glass of water and his laptop working at their table. That gave her a good first impression. He was there even earlier than she was and he was working!&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Hi Chris, it's great seeing you again” - She said.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Likewise, it's been a couple weeks. I’m glad that you have not run away yet. Sorry for the mess” as he gestures at the laptop on the desk, the sheets of paper sprawled out across the table, his notepad,&nbsp; and his company pen engraved “Tech &amp; Tech” in green.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“You are forgiven” she replies</p>
      <p>That made Chris chuckle, “Ha thank you for your kindness your highness.” He gets up from the table and shakes her hand then says “Wow I got to shake hands with loyalty, gonna brag to my wife, hopefully she doesn't get jealous that she didn’t get to do the same.”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Give me a second, I will clean up, well except for this notepad, I want to take notes during the conversation, is that okay with you?”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Yes that’s fine”, she replied, “as long as you let me do the same” she says as she gets her notepad and her favourite pen out of her purse. The pen was her favourite because that’s the only pen her dad used while he was alive.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Yes please do! Love it when people take notes too, it makes it seem like they care about what I have to say haha.”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Chris removes everything from the table, now there were only two notepads and two pens between a mentor and mentee.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Have you ever had a ‘LDA meeting’ before?”</p>
      <p>“No, first time.”</p>
      <p>“I thought so, it’s my invention!” The way he said that, she knew he cared and felt proud about this nifty invention. So she knew not to say “name sounds kinda stupid”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>instead she asked him “How did you come with that?”</p>
      <p>He beamed at that question “Well eating lunch is always a great way for people to bond, and have a conversation with each other. Lunch is only between us. This way we can discuss what the program entails. We are going to have a long lunch, let's make it fun. It’s scheduled for 4 hours. After lunch we are going to get dinner with Micheal. The point of these dinners is to do status updates with him, and he will be able to share with you and myself some observations, and some advice. He sometimes has really great ideas, ideas that I couldn't ever think up. His brain is great at improving things. I'm still smarter than him, tell him I said that” , “I will” she quickly replied. That made him smile as he continued his monologue “There are things that he does better than I do, that is why we have been partners for so long and have been able to grow the company to what it is now. After our Dinner with Michael, we will join the team at the After Party. ”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Sounds fun! Is it an actual party?” she asked.</p>
      <p>“Yes, just not a rowdy one. We rent out a bar from a friend on a slow day like today. We set up some board games, some video games, food, and alcohol. Its Tuesday so not a really popular club day unless you listen to Drake”</p>
      <p>“The party will be us, Michael and the team. Secret tip, Michael is super friendly when he is tipsy, so it's always a good time to get to know him personally. I'm friendly whenever and wherever!”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>"Roger that" - She replied</p>
      <p>“Do you want to eat now or do you want to eat later?” he continued</p>
      <p>“Well since we are going to be here for four hours and have dinner after, let's definitely start by eating!”</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Lunch</strong>
      </p>
      <p>At lunch Chris set up expectations about the program, what metrics they are going to be tracking, how they can help her in her business and future goals and how she can help them do the same during WEM.</p>
      <p>“LaShana, what is your goal with your business?” - Chris asked her.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“I want to build a lot of great value hotels and one super luxurious hotel”</p>
      <p>“Why do you have two different goals in the same industry? Fortunately they would not be competing, it seems like they are completely different business models. Can you explain that to me?”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>She answered:&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Well the great value chain of hotels is to provide as great an experience as possible for working Americans that want to spend the weekend with their partners away from their children without being too far in case of an emergency. It also has to be affordable. Everything is centred around providing them a fantastic laid back experience. We even have adult-only amenities. The luxurious hotel is because I want to be able to provide the best experience possible to our guests without sacrificing on anything due to price. They come for the best stay possible on the planet. The value will be reflected by the price”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Okay, I like those goals. Why the hotel industry?”</p>
      <p>“Well almost my entire family has worked in the hotel industry. My parents actually met in a hotel. My dad was a custodian and my mom was a consultant. I am the only one that started a business though, that’s the biggest reason why I applied for the mentorship. Also, I want to learn to market and sell to the affluent crowd.”</p>
      <p>Chris was happy to hear her motivation. It affirmed that they made the right call in picking her. “Well, we can definitely help you with business knowledge, and we sell our services to CEOs, so you will definitely get the experience there. On your application you mentioned that you were able to keep your hotel occupancy high throughout the year, right?”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;“Yes, our team is able to keep our hotel booked at near capacity year round. We plan to keep making it better and franchise it. “</p>
      <p>“That’s fantastic, as you know we are going to be opening our own retail stores soon. Your experience driving traffic will help our brick and mortar locations tremendously.”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“How far are you guys along for the retail locations?”</p>
      <p>“Not very far. We don’t even have locations in mind at the moment. We just know we want to have stores”</p>
      <p>“Okay, I can definitely help with picking the right locations. There’s a science and art to it. The location is not the only thing that matters, we also have to make sure the interior is designed properly.”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Well that’s why we have you,LaShana, as our guru.”</p>
      <p>“Ha! Okay, I will be the guru you guys need. Chris, I have a question.”</p>
      <p>“Go ahead, you can ask any questions that you have”</p>
      <p>“Looking at your bio on the website, it says you have a child, and that your wife is pregnant. Did she give birth already?”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Almost! She’s actually eight months pregnant. So in less than a month we will add another cute monster to our family. You don’t have to worry about the program. My wife and I already had a long discussion about it. For our first born, Aaron, I stayed at home with Jessica. Turns out I wasnt really needed. Our family and friends were there to support us. This time around, we will be doing things differently,&nbsp; I will continue working. You get to have me as your mentor, and don't worry! The mentorship program is fluid. If she needs me I can be there quickly and back to you quickly. ”</p>
      <p>
        <strong>After several hours. The lunch part of the LDA meeting was coming to an end…</strong>
      </p>
      <p>“LaShana, the restaurant we are going to is only one mile away. We can walk or we can take the Metro. Walking will take us about 20 minutes, and the metro 4. What would you prefer”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“I prefer walking”</p>
      <p>LaShana was thinking that this would give her more time to ask him more about Michael, and the walk was necessary for her to calm down her nerves. She attended his seminar on “How To Grow Your Business With Massive Vision” After attending his seminar, she was able to implement some of the information he shared to grow her business to $24K/ month. She also has had a small crush on him ever since. She did not think much of it, he was just another handsome rich guy, until she got accepted for the mentorship. As they were walking she concluded that it was “ like having a crush on a professor in college, it's okay to have it. You just can’t act on it. Technically Michael is my teacher, and the guy is 100% popular with women. He is tall, handsome, ambitious, super rich, and kind. Well whatever even if I wan-”</p>
      <p>“We’re here” her train of thought was interrupted by Chris pointing to the unassuming small restaurant that was in front of them.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It was a small mom &amp; pop shop. One that looked identical to all the small Italian restaurants in her hometown. She was surprised when she looked at the sign and didn’t see Italian and instead saw the boring “Your Restaurant” on their door.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As soon as they walked in the host said “you must be Chris and LaShana. Michael is waiting for you.” The host walks them to the table. The host could have just pointed to the table as the restaurant was too small for them to miss the only man seating at a table in a restaurant with 10 empty tables.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>They found Michael typing away at his keyboard. This was another great first impression for her. He was also early and working while waiting. Once Michael saw his guests he closed the lid of his laptop and placed it in the backpack that he had sitting on the floor next to him. Then he asks the host if he could please take the backpack back with him. The host answered “sure”. He rises up and says “You must be LaShana, the woman unlucky enough to have to work with Chris” he walks towards her and shakes her hand then shakes Chris’s hand. He gestures for them to sit, “you guys can go ahead and take a sit”</p>
      <p>They comply and sit. Michael is sitting by himself, directly facing LaShana and Chris sits on her left. “I was just kidding earlier. Chris is an awesome guy, and he has been a great business partner, friend, and mentor. You will definitely enjoy working with him.”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Michael is right I am all the above” he said with a small chuckle. She could see that they both appreciated each other and held each other in high esteem. The waiter arrives at their table and asks them if they are eating now or in 30 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Michael looks at LaShana and says “we usually like to start talking first, then start eating 30 minutes later. If you want we can start by eating. What would you prefer?”</p>
      <p>“Let’s talk first and eat later.” - LaShana responded</p>
      <p>“What’s your name? It’s my first time seeing you here” Chris asks the waiter.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“My name is David sir.”“Hi David, my name is Chris. Nice to meet you. You heard the lady, we will eat in 30 minutes. Thank you”</p>
      <p>“No problem sir.”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Okay guys, Let's play an ice breaker for team building. We will share our greatest strength and our biggest weakness when it comes to achieving our goals. We start with the goal first.” - Michael said.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Do you guys want me to get started” Chris asked</p>
      <p>“Go ahead” they answered.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“My goal is to grow “Tech &amp; Tech” to $100M ARR using retail store experiences. My strength is my ability to create systems and processes for businesses. My weakness is my creativity. I feel like I am not creative.” - Chris answered. “I tried all the affirmations and nothing worked until I started partnering with creative people like Michael. He and I have great synergy, that’s why we have continued the partnership”</p>
      <p>“Would you like to go next?” Michael asked LaShana. “Yes” she answered without hesitation “My goal is to reach $3M ARR by franchising our current hotel. I am strong at customer experience, and mindset is what I struggle with the most. The solution I found is definitely this mentorship, thank you so much for having me!”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Then it was finally Michael’s turn, “My goal just like Chris’s is to grow “Tech &amp;&nbsp; Tech” to $100M ARR using retail stores. My strong suit is definitely mindset and sales. My weakness is business building. You can probably tell already why we are such a great team. His weakness is my strong suit, and my weakness is his strong suit. Do you know why we picked you over all the other candidates?” - Michael asked her.</p>
      <p>“Over 10,000 candidates” Chris added to the question.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“No, I don’t know” - She replied&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of reasons, the most important is that we are able to provide you with value and you can do the same. You are strong where we are weak, and we are strong where you are weak.&nbsp; Since we have built companies that earn $3M ARR, we will definitely be able to help you get there, and stretch to $30M. We cannot promise $300M, we have not reached that yet. We are glad that we will actually be able to help you reach your dreams and you will be able to help grow our company with your experience. We have no experience in the hospitality business which is what retail stores are all about. Your hotel is welcoming, has a fantastic customer experience and we want the same for our brick and mortar locations.”</p>
      <p>Chris chimed in “Micheal is our crazy big guy. The first time we set a big sale day, my suggestion was for us to set our goal at a comfortable stretch goal of $100k. That was big, at that time our ARR was $800k. An eighth of our previous year's income in one day. Crazy right.”</p>
      <p>“Yep ” - She replied</p>
      <p>&nbsp;“I thought so too until Micehal said that we should set our goal to $1 million in a day. I thought he was being funny when he said that. Then I realised he was being serious. " Micheal continued the story " I told him we would be able to do it. I saw someone do it at a conference. He did $3 million in sales. In 2 hours. Seeing him do that made me realise what was possible. I Wanted us to do the same thing. I got Chris to believe that we could do it, and we set our plan in motion. Well more like Chris set the plan on motion. He is great at planning things, right Chris”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Yes sir”</p>
      <p>“Were you guys able to do $1 million in a day??” - she asked&nbsp;</p>
      <p>They both looked at each other then at her and said in unison “No”</p>
      <p>“We were only able to earn $400K,” Micheal added. “Fortunately because of Chris’s planning we are now able to have two big sales day a month it usually ranges between 200K - 700K in sales''&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Ooo that's awesome” LaShana replied. She couldn't understand how they were able to do such things and be so nonchalant about earning $400K in a day!! “Yeah Chris is an awesome guy, without him I don't think this company would even exist” “Ah Michael you are going to make me blush. He is right though. Hahaha. Without me this company would crash, without him the company would just stay in port. That’s basically how our partnership works, Michael guides us with his crazy ideas, sells for us, and I just make sure that I build systems to make sure our boat can go where he wants it to go. It’s a good partnership and it's going well.”</p>
      <p>Hearing those stories made LaShana feel like she was in good company and glad that she took the chance to apply for this mentorship program. They really enjoyed working together and were playing the entrepreneurship game because it was the most fun game they could play.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The waiter came to their table to ask them if they were ready.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Yes, thank you David” - Chris answered for the group.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Then he turned to LaShana and said to her “We asked a silly question on ranking your three favourite things to eat for dinner. Do you remember your answer?”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Umm Gyros, Lomo and my mom’s cooking” - She answered. “That's what you wrote on your application, only the order is different. It was Gyros in first place, your mom’s cooking in second place, and Lomo. Your current ranking is kinder to your mom’s cooking. I always thought of second place, as the first loser. Her cooking is no longer the first loser, and she is still in your top 3. “</p>
      <p>“Well if you put it that way, I will write that on a birthday card for her birthday”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“We should do that” - Michael interjected, writing it down in his notebook.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Did my mom cook for you!?” she asked, very surprised. “Well Chris really wanted to bother your mom to cook for us to surprise you, I told him that if we asked your mom then there wouldn't be a surprise, so we opted-out for that. On the menu we have Lomo and Gyros. Which would you like to have?”</p>
      <p>“Both!” - She replied enthusiastically.</p>
      <p>“Okay both for the young lady, and what do you gentlemen want?” - The waiter said.</p>
      <p>“I also want both” Micheal answered, and Chris followed suit “Well guess I will also take both too.” Michael was surprised because Chris was a picky eater who hated wasting food. Usually when they go out, he doesn't try anything new that he isn’t certain he will love. Chris’s pickiness confused Michael. They were both extremely wealthy and if the food was bad, $100 for a meal was insignificant. He concluded that it was just Chris’s personality, it worked well in business and it was only annoying in restaurant outings. He was glad that today Chris decided to step out of his comfort zone.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Okay orders coming right up” the waiter answered.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Within minutes of taking their orders the waiter came back to their table with enough food to feed 10 people. “How was this done so quickly? And why so much food? '' She asked them. “It pays to have friends in high places. We are close friends with the owner and pre-ordered the meal, that's why we got it so quickly. And for why so much food, we like to give food to soup kitchens whenever we go to fine dining establishments.” - Michael answered. “Yeah, when we first started getting into business and capitalism we read Adam Smith’s ‘The Wealth of Nations’ and he said that poor and rich people eat the same amount of food.The rich don’t eat more than the poor. We just buy expensive food more often. When we do eat “rich people food”, we like to share it with those that would not be able to easily afford it.” - Chris added.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“I hated that whenever my mom and I had to go to food banks we only got the same canned food. In a way we are bringing the change we want to see in the world. I want the next kid that has to go to the shelter with his mom tonight gets to eat some good Lomo Saltado and some good Gyros”</p>
      <p>“Well that's very kind of you guys”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“We try”</p>
      <p>The waiter out of sight added some ambient music to the dining room as they were eating. It was at a volume that allowed them to continue their conversations about business, the lessons they learned in life, and exchanging knowledge. After about 40 minutes into their conversation, LaShana’s phone started ringing. At first she ignores it. Then it continues ringing. She declined the call because she doesn't want to be rude. She then gets multiple back to back text messages. Michael realises that it is most likely something important and that she is not picking it up out of respect, so he tells her, “hey you should pick that up. It's not rude. You’re a business owner, sometimes you gotta take out some fires. “</p>
      <p>“Thank you!” she answered. As she started reading her texts, her face turned into one of worry. She looks up “one of our new employees messed up on an important procedure and since our manager is also new, she doesn't know how to fix it. I am so sorry guys, I must take her call. It will probably take 20 minutes to get this fixed. May I stop out?”</p>
      <p>Chris answered, “yes please do. Don’t worry, we will wait for you even if it takes longer than you expect. We hope it doesn’t. Eitherway you will find us here waiting for you”</p>
      <p>“Thank you so much” then she got up, called her manager and stepped outside the restaurant. While she’s outside the restaurant pacing back and forth on the phone Michael turns to Chris with a serious look.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;“What's up man? Why are you looking at me like that?</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to the party. Well I can’t go to the party”</p>
      <p>“Huh, why not? Did something come up?”</p>
      <p>“Bro she’s too cute. I can’t be spending that much time so close to her. It feels like a date, and I am a little nervous” is what Michael wanted to say. Instead he had to come with an excuse, so he took his phone out, and said “my mom said she urgently needs my help with something”</p>
      <p>“Okay, you don’t have to come to the party. You have to wait for her to finish her call though before you leave.”“Yeah that’s what I was planning on doing”</p>
      <p>“Good”</p>
      <p>Nearly 30 minutes later, LaShana comes back to the restaurant, sees them typing away on their computer. “Thanks for your patience guys, sorry it took so long”&nbsp; and she sits back down.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“It's all good. Things happen. Did everything get resolved?” Chris asked, as they shuffled their computer back in their bags, seconds after they did that the waiter came with 2 plates of chocolate chip cookies, a jug of warm milk, and a jug of cold milk.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“LaShana, chocolate cookies are my favourite. I would love to share them with you. I made them from scratch. Unfortunately I will not be able to go to the after party later. Something came up that I have to deal with.” - Michael added.</p>
      <p>“That's disappointing, well at least you got us cookies! Are they all chocolate chip cookies? And did you actually bake them yourself?”</p>
      <p>Michaels eyes beamed with excitement when she asked about his baking hobby.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Yes I did bake all of them! And yes, they’re all chocolate chip cookies! There are four flavours though! We have the classic chocolate chip cookie on this half of the plate” while he point to the plate that had the small white flag that had a big letter A on one side and on the other side the menu read “Classic chocolate chip &amp; Chocolate galaxy” On plate “B” the menu was “Choconut chip cookies &amp; Mint Chocolate Chip Cookies”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Wow you really went all out” - LaShana surprised with the quantity and variety&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Yeah he always does when he bakes cookies”</p>
      <p>“Which one is your favourite? ” - She asked, looking at Micheal.</p>
      <p>He replied “I have a least favourite. The others I like equally”&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“He dislikes my favourite cookie, Chocolate galaxy “ - Chris answered for him&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“He is right, I find them too chocolatey for my palette. I tried making them one day because I thought Chris would love them. My hypothesis was correct. Whenever cookies and Chris are in the same room, I make sure to bake some Chocolate Galaxy. He often eats a whole batch by himself! So grab some early if you want to try them.” He said with a tone of joy and pride that his friend loves the cookies he invented for him.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“He’s kidding. Well partly. I used to be a cookie monster, now I am a mature ‘Chocolate Galaxy’ enjoyer” - Chris said laughing</p>
      <p>“Well, i’m just going to take one of each then” - She said while using the tong the waiter brought for the cookies.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“You’re a smart woman. That’s why you won the internship” - Chris replied&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“That was the most important reason. Your ability to pick cookies is very important in the business world” - Micheal added.</p>
      <p>Then they all started laughing. After about 10 more minutes of conversation Micheal’s phone starts ringing. “Sorry guys, it's time for me to go. Chris as always it was nice to have dinner with you. We have been pretty busy, it was nice to catch up.” and looking at LaShana, “It was a great meeting with you today. I am very excited to work with you. You are a phenomenal individual, and looking forward to both of our businesses growing with this mentorship”</p>
      <p>“Thank you for the opportunity. You are super cool. Looking forward to working with both of you guys” - She replied</p>
      <p>*cough* “especially with me” *cough* - Chris added</p>
      <p>“Yes, especially with you” LaShana laughed, with her mentors’ laughter soon following. Micheal stands followed by Chris then LaShana. “Well, I’ll see you guys next week” as he shakes Chris’s hand, then he subconsciously starts the move of going for a hug with LaShana as he raises both of his arms to start the hugging motion. He quickly realises and drops his left arm as if he was yanking a toddler to stop him from hitting a wall. He lowers his right arm so that it can be in handshake height with LaShana. They shook hands and Michael left the duo and headed home.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Michael on his way home:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>“Fuck why is she prettier in person. She smells phenomenal. She’s super cool. She loves business and reading. She’s actually really kind, and has a fantastic personality. Shit, she’s definitely my type. I haven't met a woman like her in years. Why did I have to meet her as a mentee? We should have met anywhere else in the world. Why did this have to happen? Chris shouldn't have picked her! How do I tell Chris about this? I avoided the after party just because of a crush, it's an embarrassing thing to tell Chris. Fuck why is this happening. Honestly she’s the type of woman that Napoleon Hill would advise me to marry. We could have a phenomenally successful life together. If only she was not my mentee. Man I hate this! “</p>
