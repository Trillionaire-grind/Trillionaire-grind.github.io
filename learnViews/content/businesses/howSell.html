                    In this video, we're going to be talking about sales. We'll go over 10 topics, and each topic 
                    will be very short—about a minute each. I'll start with the 10 topics we'll discuss:<br><br>
                    
                    1. Ask for the sale.<br>
                    2. Objection handling.<br>
                    3. Show your offer to the right crowd.<br>
                    4. Build rapport.<br>
                    5. When they start asking questions, that's good.<br>
                    6. If they are ready to buy, stop talking.<br>
                    7. What do they want?<br>
                    8. Price is never the issue; it's rarely the issue.<br>
                    9. Use the yes framework.<br>
                    10. A customer is always a customer.<br><br>
                    
                    The first one is the most important: asking for the sale. You’re doing this entire dance; 
                    maybe you did the marketing to get them into your funnel so you can close them. 
                    You did this entire thing so you can actually ask them to give you money in exchange for the offer. 
                    So you must remember to ask for the sale. That’s the entire point of what you’ve been doing. 
                    You’re there to ask them to give you money, so you must remember to do that, even if you think the 
                    prospect is not going to buy.<br><br> 
                    
                    There are two reasons why you should ask for the sale. The first is that the prospect may actually 
                    purchase; they just need you to ask them clearly to purchase. A clear call to action—that's all they need. 
                    Some people just need you to ask them for their money. I've walked up to strangers and asked, 
                    "Will you give me 50 bucks?" and they said yes, simply because I asked.<br><br>
                    
                    The second reason is that you want to build the habit of asking for the sale. If you tell yourself, 
                    "Oh, this prospect wasn’t ready to purchase; they would say no if I asked," 
                    then you create a habit of maybe I'll ask this person or maybe I won't. 
                    You must build the habit of asking everyone for the sale, even if they don't want to buy. 
                    You need that repetition in your mind so you can always ask for the sale during conversations.<br><br>
                    
                    The second topic is objection handling. This is part of the game and will happen often. 
                    There are different reasons why a prospect can have objections—sometimes they’re valid, 
                    and sometimes they’re not; they just don’t want to take action now. The easiest way to figure this out
                    is that objections are a window into their mind regarding what will make them purchase. 
                    Listen to them, handle those objections, and practice for common objections, so you’re ready to address 
                    them.<br><br>
                    
                    For example, if you’re selling crayons and they say, "I have crayons at home," you can explain, 
                    "Sure, but you don’t have 46 colors with your crayons. You can't create the art piece you’ve always 
                    wanted to have." That’s an example of handling an objection.<br><br>
                    
                    The third important point is to show your offer to the right crowd. For instance, 
                    if you're selling bras and you go to a sports bar where there are a lot of men, 
                    it will be very difficult to close a sale there because men don’t typically buy bras for themselves. 
                    If you want to sell bras, go to a place where there are a lot of women, ideally a place where women 
                    frequently buy bras.<br><br>
                    
                    Number four: build rapport. There’s a phrase that says people buy from those they like, know, 
                    and trust. In a selling environment, the prospect must like you to purchase. 
                    They need to trust what you’re saying, whether that comes from testimonials, your personal authority, 
                    or having a personable relationship. They must feel that you’re selling them something you believe in 
                    and that they can trust will deliver.<br><br>
                    
                    Number five: when they ask questions, that’s good. If the prospect starts asking you questions, 
                    it means the sales process is going in the right direction. They’re engaged and thinking about 
                    how your offer fits their needs, wants, desires, and lifestyle. Figure out what their questions 
                    mean and how you can position your offer to answer them properly. If your offer fits, answering 
                    their questions will build credibility and lower their barriers.<br><br>
                    
                    Number six: if they’re ready to buy, stop talking. If your prospect says, "Okay, let me purchase," 
                    don’t give them more information. Don’t say, "Wait, before you purchase, let me tell you this." 
                    They’ve already decided they want to purchase, so let them. Your goal is to take their money, 
                    so ask how they want to pay—by card, cash, or check. The more ways you can accept payment, the better.<br><br>
                    
                    Number seven: what do they want? Throughout your entire sales conversation, the most important thing is 
                    what the prospect wants. You don’t matter during the conversation; your getting money doesn’t matter. 
                    They only care about themselves. When you’re selling, make sure to figure out what they want.<br><br> 
                    
                    I had an interaction with a gentleman when I was downtown. I was holding a book, and he praised me, 
                    saying, "You must be smart and ambitious for reading that book." He was selling a religious text, 
                    and after the quick intro, he positioned his text by saying that many people I admire read this 
                    book and that it helped them succeed. He sold me on what I wanted—success and prestige. 
                    He made me feel great and focused on what I wanted rather than what he wanted to sell.<br><br>
                    
                    Number eight: price is rarely the issue. Price depends on the value the person perceives they’re getting.
                    For example, if you’re selling a car for $100,000, and it’s just an ordinary Toyota, 
                    people won’t purchase it because they don’t see the value. However, if you’re selling a 
                    Rolls-Royce Phantom, which is usually valued at $600,000, for $100,000, people will want to buy it 
                    because they perceive it as a great deal.<br><br> 
                    
                    Another example involves price shopping. If two companies are selling crayons—Company A for $10 and 
                    Company B for $5—Company B will likely win because they’re cheaper. However, if Company A adds
                    value by creating a package that includes crayons, coloring books, and colored pencils for $30, 
                    then the value proposition changes. The price becomes less significant because now it’s about 
                    whether the children will enjoy it.<br><br>
                    
                    Number nine: the yes framework. This is based on Dale Carnegie’s principles from 
                    "How to Win Friends and Influence People." When using the yes framework, 
                    you want to get the prospect to say yes as often as possible. Start with simple questions that lead 
                    to yes answers. For instance, ask, "Are you having a good day?" They’ll likely say yes. 
                    Then ask, "Are you looking to buy crayons?" They’ll say yes again. Keep leading them to yes 
                    until you ask for the sale. This way, they’ve been saying yes throughout the conversation, 
                    making it harder for them to say no at the end.<br><br>
                    
                    Finally, number ten: a customer is always a customer. This principle, often mentioned by Gary Halbert, 
                    states that if someone purchases from you once, they’re the best prospect because they’re very likely to 
                    buy again. I experienced this with Russell Brunson; I consumed his content for a while before making 
                    my first purchase. Once I bought one thing, I began purchasing more. Keep in mind that if you have 
                    prospects you’ve sold to, maintain a list of them and send them more offers. They’re more likely to 
                    buy again because they trust you.<br>
