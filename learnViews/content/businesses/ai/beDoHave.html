    <h1>🧠 The Secret of <em>Be. Do. Have.</em></h1>

    <p><strong>Be. Do. Have.</strong> flips the usual success script. Most people think, “When I <em>have</em> more time or money, I’ll <em>do</em> the work, and then I’ll <em>be</em> successful.” The framework reverses it: first you decide who you must <em>be</em>, then you <em>do</em> what that person does, and you <em>have</em> the results they get. Identity drives actions; actions produce outcomes.</p>

    <h2>🎯 What You’ll Learn</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Why identity-level change outperforms willpower</li>
      <li>How to define a clear “Be” statement that guides behavior</li>
      <li>Daily “Do” practices that compound into results</li>
      <li>Designing environments that make the right actions easier</li>
      <li>Measuring “Have” without losing the bigger picture</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>👤 Step 1: Start With <em>Be</em> (Identity)</h2>
    <p>Outcomes lag behind identity. Choose the kind of person you are becoming and write it as a present-tense statement:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sales:</strong> “I am a trusted advisor who solves real problems.”</li>
      <li><strong>Health:</strong> “I am an athlete who trains daily.”</li>
      <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> “I am a calm, decisive leader who develops others.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Keep it specific, values-based, and behavior-linked. Your “Be” is the compass for every decision that follows.</p>

    <h2>🛠️ Step 2: Define the <em>Do</em> (Behaviors)</h2>
    <p>Translate identity into visible, schedulable actions. If your “Be” is a trusted advisor, your “Do” might include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make <code>10</code> quality outreach messages daily focused on value, not pitching</li>
      <li>Run a weekly pipeline review to identify stuck deals and next best actions</li>
      <li>Study one customer case per day; log insights in a playbook</li>
      <li>Block <code>60</code> minutes for deep work before checking messages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make it tiny, trackable, and time-bound. If it can’t go on a calendar or habit tracker, refine it until it can.</p>

    <h2>🏆 Step 3: Clarify the <em>Have</em> (Outcomes)</h2>
    <p>Now specify results and guard against vanity metrics. Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Have” <code>3</code> new qualified opportunities per week (quality defined by ICP checklist)</li>
      <li>“Have” bodyweight deadlift by Q2; resting heart rate under <code>60</code></li>
      <li>“Have” a team engagement score above last quarter by <code>+10%</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Great goals are the scoreboard, not the playbook. Keep focus on the “Be” and “Do”—the “Have” will follow.</p>

    <h2>🧭 Step 4: Build Identity Loops</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cue:</strong> Place your running shoes by the door; CRM opens on startup.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Do a <code>2</code>-minute “starter step” (one email, one pushup, one call).</li>
      <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Check off the habit; log a quick win; celebrate with a micro-reward.</li>
      <li><strong>Belief:</strong> “I am the kind of person who…”—reinforced daily.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🏗️ Step 5: Design Your Environment</h2>
    <p>Environment beats motivation. Make the right action the easy action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Default your phone to grayscale; remove time-sink apps from home screen</li>
      <li>Keep a “one-tap” call list of top prospects or stakeholders</li>
      <li>Prep gear the night before; pre-write opening lines for outreach</li>
      <li>Use friction: website blockers during deep work, calendar holds for proactive tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📈 Step 6: Track Inputs, Not Just Outputs</h2>
    <p>Outputs lag; inputs compound. Create an <strong>identity scorecard</strong> with daily/weekly inputs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily: outreach done, workout completed, learning block finished</li>
      <li>Weekly: pipeline review, retrospective, long-run, 1:1s held</li>
      <li>Monthly: skill assessment, system upgrade, environment audit</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧹 Step 7: Edit Ruthlessly</h2>
    <p>Ask weekly: “What would the person I’m becoming <em>stop</em> doing?” Remove energy leaks—unbound commitments, low-yield channels, cluttered workflows. Subtract before you add.</p>

    <h2>🌟 Benefits of Living Be → Do → Have</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Less procrastination—identity settles the debate before it starts</li>
      <li>Consistency through setbacks (you act from who you are, not how you feel)</li>
      <li>Cleaner focus on high-signal activities</li>
      <li>Compounding confidence as actions create evidence</li>
      <li>Outcomes that feel inevitable rather than accidental</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🚀 How To Get Started (Today)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Write a one-line “Be” statement in present tense and post it where you work</li>
      <li>List three “Do” actions you will perform daily (make them tiny and schedulable)</li>
      <li>Choose one “Have” metric for the next 30 days; review every Friday</li>
      <li>Redesign one surface in your environment to make the next action obvious</li>
      <li>Run a 10-minute weekly retro: keep / start / stop—tie each to identity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💬 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Don’t wait to have more so you can do more so you can be more. Decide who you are, do what that person does, and you’ll have what follows. Identity first. Action next. Results last.
