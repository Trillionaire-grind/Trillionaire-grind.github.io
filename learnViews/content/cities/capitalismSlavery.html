                "From chattel slavery except that it's temporary, 
                and that was such a popular idea that it was a position of the Republican Party
                that Abraham Lincoln espoused. It makes sense. I mean, 
                there's nothing holy about wage labor; you are renting yourself, 
                which is not very different from being a slave."<br>
                — Noam Chomsky<br><br>

                Noam Chomsky is a prominent figure in American liberalism who equates slavery and 
                wage labor as being the same under capitalism. So, I wanted to know what capitalism is, 
                and I did what most people of our generation do in our current time: I Googled it.<br><br>

                I looked at pictures to see how people depict capitalism. Some images were pro-capitalism
                and some were anti-capitalism, and I want to share both sides with you so you can see 
                for yourself and decide whether you agree or disagree with each image.<br><br>

                The first image shows a Black man and a white man being exploited under capitalism. 
                They are working for the capitalist's factory and are being taken advantage of for profit.
                This image is important because it shows that capitalism does not care about your skin color; 
                it will exploit you no matter what you look like.<br><br>

                Next, we have a picture of Milton Friedman. If you've never heard of him, 
                he's a Nobel Prize-winning economist who believed that capitalism was the best thing 
                since sliced bread. He would argue that without capitalism, we would never have sliced bread, 
                and he thought capitalism was a beacon of freedom. He had a very positive view of capitalism
                and also believed in lower taxes, no matter what.<br><br>

                Then we have an image that addresses the American colonies, which relied on slave labor, 
                stating that the system is essentially the same—capitalists exploiting people for maximum profit.
                This is connected to the deregulation by Republicans, the American conservative party 
                (socially and economically).<br><br>

                We also have a graph that many pro-capitalists mention, showing GDP growth in various countries.
                As you can see, China was extremely poor in the 1990s and is now one of the wealthiest nations 
                on the planet because it adopted capitalist principles. Interestingly,
                Adam Smith in "Wealth of Nations" mentioned that China would remain poor because 
                it had been poor for a thousand years. Due to capitalist principles, 
                China has now become one of the wealthiest nations in history.<br><br>

                There is a common view of capitalism where the elite crush the working class for 
                profit—it's self-explanatory. Money is the biggest symbol of capitalism. 
                To pro-capitalists, money is a good thing; it shows that you've provided value to someone
                in an exchange. It's the blood of an economy. Conversely, anti-capitalists see money
                as something bloody—representing exploitation and suffering. Given that the Western
                world is strongly influenced by Christianity, there is a famous phrase: 
                "The love of money is the root of all evil," highlighting that the accumulation of wealth is 
                not good.<br><br>

                This image was drawn during Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, 
                showing the inequality created by capitalists who own all the wealth
                while workers own nearly nothing. This is why some argue that the US is heading toward failure, 
                and socialism, which is what Bernie advocates, could save America.<br><br>

                After reading about capitalism, socialism, and communism, I want to know: 
                Is capitalism pro-slavery? Is that depiction correct? Is Noam Chomsky correct in saying 
                that wage labor is the same as slavery under capitalism? Before finding an answer,
                we need to define each term clearly.<br><br>

                Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of
                production and the operation for profit.<br><br>

                Imagine you're under capitalism and someone owns a factory that creates pencils. 
                It costs them a dollar to create a pencil (including paying their laborer). 
                They sell a pencil for $2 and keep the $1 profit for each pencil sold. 
                They don't share profits with the laborers; they just keep it.<br><br>

                Slavery is the practice or institution of holding people as chattel, involuntarily, 
                and under threat of violence. A slave is someone who gets beaten or threatened to work.<br><br>

                An employee (wage laborer) is a person employed for wages or salary, especially at 
                a non-executive level. Noam Chomsky suggests they are basically the same as slaves, 
                but based on these definitions, they are definitely not. One is getting paid for their work;
                the other is getting beaten or potentially killed for not working. Very different motivations.<br><br>

                To explore the relationship between capitalism and slavery, let's assume you are a lazy,
                greedy capitalist who only cares about earning money. You have two options: 
                employ workers (paid laborers) or use slaves (free labor). 
                Which would be better for your business?<br><br>

                You start a burger joint, a simple business where you sell one type of burger to customers.
                Each burger costs you $50 to manufacture, including everything from taxes to rent. 
                You sell each burger for $2, and you find that an employee can make 134 burgers in eight hours.
                This means you earn $268 a day, spending about $67 on materials. Paying your laborer 
                minimum wage ($10 an hour) costs you $80, resulting in a profit of $121 a day.<br><br>

                Meanwhile, your employees work 40 hours a week and net less money than you. 
                You pay them $1,600 a month, and they have to cover their expenses—rent, transportation, 
                food, healthcare, retirement—leaving them with almost nothing.<br><br>

                Then you hear about buying slaves for free labor, which sounds enticing. 
                Your wealthy dad gives you a slave for free, so you fire your employee and put your slave 
                to work. On the first day, the slave makes five burgers and eats them all, 
                leaving you with only $22.50 in profit.<br><br>

                Frustrated, you call your dad, who tells you that since your slave doesn't want to work, 
                you have to beat them. You hire someone to do this for you, which requires paying a 
                higher wage than minimum. Now you have to cover more expenses, like rent and food 
                for the slave, and the slave produces even fewer burgers, further reducing your revenue.<br><br>

                At the end of the month, your net profit is only $345, meaning "free labor" is costing you 
                more money and adding complexity to your management because you now have two employees
                instead of one.<br><br>

                To understand this fully, I turned to "Wealth of Nations" by Adam Smith, 
                who is considered the father of capitalism. It's important to note that he didn't 
                create capitalism; he wrote about it and remains one of its most influential writers.<br><br>

                In Book One, Chapter 9, he discusses slavery, stating that the wear and tear of a 
                slave is the expense of their master, and that hiring free workers generally costs 
                less than maintaining slaves. Throughout history, it has always been more expensive
                to have slaves than to pay workers.<br><br>

                In Book One, Chapter One, he mentions that a frugal and industrious worker can enjoy
                more necessities and conveniences than any savage, illustrating how capitalism 
                allows even the poorest to improve their circumstances.<br><br>

                By saving capital, a laborer can hire others and improve their situation, 
                which isn't possible under slavery. In a capitalist system, a worker who is frugal 
                can accumulate capital and use it to earn more, while under socialism, 
                one is either part of the elite or not, with no opportunity for capital accumulation.<br><br>

                So, capitalism is not pro-slavery. The lazy, greedy capitalist actually loses money 
                by having slaves, while the worker suffers under slavery with no chance to retire. 
                The only person who benefits from slavery in capitalism is the one 
                who enjoys inflicting pain, as they profit from the exploitation.<br><br>

                I wrote this piece because many socialist and communist think tanks 
                equate capitalism with slavery, which is not accurate. 
                It's demeaning to past and current victims of slavery to suggest that being paid for work 
                is the same as being beaten into submission. 
                Lastly, I am a capitalist and pro-capitalism. 
                Thank you for watching. Let me know your thoughts 
                and whether you agree or disagree with my assessment.<br><br>
