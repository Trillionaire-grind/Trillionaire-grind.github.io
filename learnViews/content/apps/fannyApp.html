                    If you want to do something the best way, the way to do that is by practicing. 
                    This video is to help you practice the skill of building apps. 
                    In this video, we're going to build Fanny's app—it's a super easy and 
                    simple app that can be built in less than one hour, 
                    especially because most of the bugs have been fixed over the years.
                    I say most because there might be some bugs that I have yet to encounter. 
                    So, if you encounter them, then you have to fix them. 
                    It’s going to be really great for you to learn how to actually debug stuff. 
                    I’ll make a video on debugging if you want that.<br><br>

                    The video is split into three major sections:
                    before building, building the app, and post-build. 
                    Things are not always fully built, so even if the app looks perfect after your 
                    internal testing, there are almost always going to be improvements. 
                    There will always be new technologies and updates. 
                    Post-building is actually going to be the longest process because it's ongoing. 
                    To make your life easier, if you want to have access to the full source code of 
                    this project and any project shared on this channel, 
                    then you can get the full source code for only $1 a month. 
                    If you're interested, there’s a link below in the subscription description 
                    for you to access it. Once you purchase the subscription, 
                    I will send that to you—please give us up to 24 hours just to make sure you get access.<br><br>

                    Now, before we get started, I'd like to share the difficulty of this project.
                    If you have already built an Android app, then this is going to be super easy. 
                    If you know Java but have never built an Android app, 
                    then I would say this is still going to be easy. If you don’t know Java,
                    it falls into the medium area of difficulty. If you do not know how to code,
                    then yes, this will be difficult—you'll have to rewatch this video multiple times. 
                    If you're watching this and you didn’t get the source code, 
                    then you're going to have to rewind and pause a lot. 
                    If you have the source code, then it's easy; 
                    you just download it and follow along as I explain.<br><br>

                    That being said, I do think that if you know Java, 
                    it’s not going to be a big deal because this app is built in Java. 
                    If you don't know any programming, you should still watch. However, 
                    this video does not cover the programming basics; 
                    we go over the logic of what we're building, not the basics. 
                    If you feel stuck and want to understand more about programming, 
                    I highly recommend going on YouTube to find some tutorials on how to code, 
                    specifically looking for Java. There is a plethora of free information on YouTube; 
                    that's how I was able to build apps—mostly from YouTube. I did learn programming 
                    from professors and teachers, but most of what I know is from people on YouTube, 
                    which is also the reason why I’m doing this: to provide value to others.<br><br>

                    There’s a nice YouTube video titled 
                    "Introduction to Programming and Computer Science: A Full Course,"
                    and I will include that in the description. They also have a website
                     for more structured learning called freecodecamp.org, 
                     so you can check that out and learn.<br><br>

                    Before we get started, I’m going to show you guys what we're going to be building. 
                    Let’s take a look at the app currently so that we know what we're going to build. 
                    It’s called Fanny after our client. There are categories of quotes that she can click on,
                    and she also has a new category button. For example, 
                    if she wants to create a category around sales, then she just writes "sales" 
                    here and adds it. That will be there. If she wants to get quotes when she’s feeling angry,
                    then she would click here, and this way she'll get the quote. 
                    If she wants to get a new quote, then she clicks "New Quote." 
                    As you can see, there are the quotes here and the actual source.
                    If she wants to edit this quote, she just clicks on "Edit" right down below,
                    and she's able to edit. Once she's done, she presses "Save," and it saves,
                    so she can’t edit it anymore.<br><br>

                    Now, this is what the code is actually going to show. If we click "New Quote" multiple times, 
                    we can see that it actually saved. This is what the new quote is. If she wants to delete it, 
                    she should press the delete button right below, and it's going to give her an alert dialogue 
                    to make sure she wants to actually delete it. If she presses "Yes," 
                    we’re going to delete all the quotes. There are only five, so now there are no more quotes. 
                    Because of the way the app is built, technically there is one quote—it's just an empty quote. 
                    What she can do is either edit that one quote by clicking "Edit" again
                    or add a new quote by pressing the "New Quote" button. It will show a dialogue with two edit texts:
                    one for the quote and one for the source. For that, we’re going to do another new quote. 
                    She'll type "New Quote" as the source, and then she presses "Add."<br><br>

                    If we press "New Quote," it doesn’t always show up randomly, but we can check it. 
                    Right here, you can see it actually got saved. If we go back, unfortunately, 
                    it is erased because everything is hardcoded, so whenever something gets closed, 
                    it is completely gone. We’re going to talk about this later in the video regarding how we can fix this. 
                    This project is a simple project for you to learn some skills and lessons. 
                    In this case, some of the things you’re going to learn are how to add onClick listeners, 
                    how to add an onLongClick listener, how to create an alert dialogue, and how to add a RecyclerView,
                    which is what this is—a RecyclerView.<br><br> 

                    Keep watching, and you will learn how to do this. 
                    If you want to get the source code for easy reference, 
                    you can do so for this project and all the projects shared on this channel for only $1 a month.
                    If you want access, there’s a link down below for you to get it, so do that if you’re interested, 
                    and keep watching so you can build this app.<br><br>

                    As I shared in the previous section of this video, there are a couple of things you're going to learn 
                    throughout this process that you'll use in any of your projects. Most projects will actually end up 
                    using these things, and it’s going to be really beneficial.
                    The RecyclerView is a great way to display data with a good UI. 
                    Any scrolling action usually uses some kind of RecyclerView. We’re going to use ArrayAdapters,
                    which are the way to attach data to the UI of the RecyclerView so people can see the information
                    you're displaying.<br><br>

                    We’re going to use onClick listeners for buttons. 
                    If you ever have a button in your project, you will have to use an onClick listener. 
                    The onLongClick listener, I'm not sure if it's called press or click; I think it's click. 
                    That’s also something you're going to implement. It’s not used as much as the onClick listener, 
                    but it is used—it's essentially the double-click on phones. You're going to learn about intents; 
                    that’s the way we navigate from one activity to another. You need to do that because 
                    if you use different activities, then it’s essential to go from one to the other.<br><br>

                    We’re going to learn to use alert dialogues; a simple alert dialogue will be used for prompts. 
                    If you want to prompt the user before they do something—like deleting something, 
                    for example—you want to ask them for confirmation. This two-step method is essential
                    because sometimes users might accidentally delete something and then regret it. You don’t want 
                    to do that, especially when deleting. If someone is writing something and just presses delete 
                    without warning, that’s frustrating. So, you want to provide a warning for your users.<br><br>

                    I’ll include timestamps in the description so you can refer back to them for any other projects 
                    you’re building, not just this one. Like I said, these concepts will be used quite often, 
                    so make sure to refer back to this video if you're struggling. There are obviously many 
                    resources available for different learning styles, and this is just one way to learn. 
                    I like videos too, which is why I’m doing this.<br><br>

                    The reason I say this app is easy is that the logic is super simple. 
                    It's not a fully fledged product, and the UI is very basic,
                    which is why this app can be built in such a short time. Since I've already built it out, 
                    it makes it even faster because you don’t have to think too much about the logic 
                    as you go through the project. As you implement some of the things, 
                    you’ll have everything there, and you can improve it. I also include a section in this video
                    on how to improve the app, so you can enhance it however you want—you could improve the UI, 
                    the functions, or anything and everything because it is very basic. 
                    The intent is just for learning and practice, so you can build something relatively quickly. 
                    It’s going to take you less than an hour, really. If you have the source code, 
                    it’s just going to take the time it takes to actually run the app—maybe a couple of minutes.<br><br>

                    **Section 1: Before Building**<br><br>

                    This is a necessary step. You don’t want to start building without any idea of what you're going to build.
                    The first thing you want to know is what we’re building. In our case, a friend of mine, aka Fanny, 
                    mentioned she wanted an app like this. She wanted an inspiration app with categories, 
                    the ability to add quotes, and the ability to edit those quotes—that's what we’re building. 
                    This conversation happened a while ago, so I’m extrapolating from memory; 
                    I'm not exactly sure what she wants exactly.<br><br>
 
                    Exactly which I will also mention in how we can improve the app. 
                    A really good way to improve it is by having a conversation with our client. 
                    So, if you're thinking of consulting or things of that nature, then this is a very important step: 
                    talk to your client and figure out what it is that they want. Sometimes they struggle, 
                    and I've noticed that because they've never built software, they don't know what they want. 
                    They might just think, "Oh, software is cool."<br><br>

                    A really good way to do this is by providing them examples of things, which could be 
                    from major companies. Make sure when you explain these things to them, you remember your limitations, 
                    especially in terms of time. Don’t mention complex AI models if you cannot implement them in a 
                    timely manner or if the customer doesn’t have the budget to hire outside consultants to help with 
                    the project. Keep those limitations in mind. If they have the budget and time, feel free to share all 
                    the greatest ideas. If they have a budget that allows for X, make sure you only show them X—don’t 
                    show them Y or Z.<br><br>

                    From our conversation, I remember she wanted to be able to edit, delete, and add, so that’s what the 
                    app will do. Another important question before I start building is: does this exist now? 
                    This question is especially crucial if you're looking to create a solution for a problem. 
                    The reason for this is that if there’s a solution that already exists and works well, 
                    there’s no point in investing your time or money into building something else. As they say, 
                    you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. So if the wheel already exists, you don’t have to do it.<br><br>

                    That being said, if it exists and you notice that the wheel is actually square instead of round, 
                    you know there’s a market for it. People are downloading it, and if you can improve it and make 
                    it much better, then people will go to your product. However, I’m not saying you’re just going 
                    to find your product; you’ll have to market and sell it. If it’s just a slightly better square wheel, 
                    then no one will want that because it’s hard to get people to move away from what they already have.<br><br> 

                    If you’re asking them to switch from a square wheel to a slightly better square wheel, 
                    that’s a hard sell. But if you tell them, "Hey, this thing is actually a square wheel. 
                    I have a round wheel that goes way further and is more efficient," 
                    then it’s a much easier sell, and people will actually leave what they already have.<br><br> 

                    Now, regarding what you’re building, the best way to figure this out is actually by writing down a
                    pen-and-paper wireframe of the app. It’s very simple; you might not be able to see this clearly.
                    Essentially, it’s a RecyclerView. They click it, and it opens another screen that shows the category, 
                    the quotes, the buttons here, and the dialogues that come in if they want to delete or add a new quote.<br><br>

                    Once you've done that, there are a couple of benefits: first, you can figure out what the flow is going 
                    to be like, which is very important. Second, you can actually share it with people. 
                    If you're building this as a business, this is a really important step because it allows you to 
                    share it with potential customers. This way, they can tell you what would make it better.<br><br> 

                    That being said, people don’t always know what they want. 
                    However, it will still give you a hint about what could improve the app.
                    If they see something that doesn’t make sense, you know it doesn't work. 
                    If they’re like, "Oh wow, this is great; I understand this," then you know you’re on the right track.<br><br>

                    Another thing is that it allows you to collaborate. If you're working with a client, 
                    for example, it helps you understand if what you think they're talking about makes sense because now 
                    it’s visual. It’s easier to interpret, and they can clarify their ideas more effectively.<br><br> 

                    You want to make sure to do this on pen and paper first. It’s really cheap and quick, 
                    and you can edit easily. It allows you to visualize how the database should interact 
                    and how the UX will be structured. This helps with user experience and collaboration, 
                    so if you’re working with a team, you can give each other feedback and figure out how to 
                    structure everything.<br><br>

                    Once you’ve finalized the pen-and-paper version, the next step would be to actually design it. 
                    I’ve realized that sometimes on paper, dimensions can be odd, and things that seem to make sense 
                    could look ugly in a proper design. That's why you would do the digital design and test colors; 
                    on paper, you might not see the actual colors.<br><br>

                    I don’t have the Adobe XD files for this project, so I won’t be able to share the original version, 
                    which is slightly different from the final product. You’ll notice that you refine your designs as 
                    you build out the project, and the final product may differ from the initial design due to 
                    limitations or time constraints.<br><br>

                    ### Tools for Design<br><br>

                    What tools can you actually use to design? You can use Adobe's suite, like Photoshop or Adobe XD. 
                    I do use Adobe XD, but I don't recommend the free version because it used to work well, 
                    and now it’s not as reliable. You can also use PowerPoint, Sketch, or Figma.
                    I haven’t really looked into Figma because I don’t like web apps, but it seems to have some advantages.<br><br>

                    ### Section Two: Building<br><br>

                    Now that we know what we want to build and what it should look like, we can actually start building it.
                    For this particular project, it’s already been coded. You’ll have a view of the code and 
                    an explanation of what each snippet does. If you're interested in getting the full source code, 
                    you can find a link in the description below. It’s only a dollar a month, 
                    and you get access to this project’s source code and any others shared on this channel.<br><br>

                    The project is structured into three packages: activities, array adapters, and objects. 
                    The activities package has two activities: the main activity and the quote activity. 
                    Our array adapter only has one, which is the categories adapter, 
                    and our objects folder contains two objects: the category object and the quote object.<br><br>

                    So, what’s in our main activity? Our main activity has just two UI components: 
                    a RecyclerView and a button. The RecyclerView shows the categories of quotes, 
                    and the new button is for adding a new category. After we set up these two components, 
                    I’ll show you the XML layout.<br><br> 

                    So, here’s the activity_main XML layout. I’ll do a screen split so you can see it clearly.<br><br> 

                    It shows the button and the RecyclerView, with their respective IDs. After setting up the UI, 
                    the next step was to populate the RecyclerView with data. We did this by creating a 
                    hardcoded array list of categories.<br><br> 

                    We created an ArrayList called "data" for categories, initialized it, and then added one to six categories.
                    The next step is to implement the CategoriesAdapter, which will connect our data to the RecyclerView and allow 
                    us to manage the display of categories effectively.
                    Sure! Here’s your text with improved formatting, spelling, and grammar while keeping the 
                    original wording as much as possible:<br><br>


                    Categories—now the next step is actually to know what a category is. It’s one of the objects 
                    that we've created, among the two objects. A category is a very simple object; 
                    all it does is contain a string title. That’s all it has. So when you initialize a category,
                    you can initialize it as an empty object or with a title. We have a getter and a setter: getTitle 
                    and setTitle. We don’t use setTitle, so we can erase that, and getTitle we do use throughout the project.<br><br>

                    So the next step in the RecyclerView is to set the adapter to be a new CategoriesAdapter.
                    We'll go over that a little bit later. For now, we're going to cover the item decoration. 
                    The item decoration is pretty simple; it adds some space between each element. 
                    In the project, when you saw the buttons, there was space in between—that's what the item decoration 
                    is for. We also added a GridLayoutManager so that it’s not just a list that’s one by one; 
                    it becomes a grid. We set it to two columns. If we set it to three, it would be three columns. 
                    Since we have eight elements, it would be 3 by 2.5, basically 3 by 3, and one row would only have two rows.<br><br>

                    This is the class for the item decoration. If you want to use this,
                     I’ll share it with you on the screen so you can copy and paste it. 
                     If you don't have the source code, you can always get it for just a buck. 
                     You can pause it if you want; this is just to show you the actual code.<br><br>

                    Since the CategoriesAdapter is more intricate, we’re going to go over the actual setOnClickListener 
                    with the new button. When we created the setOnClickListener, it just means that once the button sees that 
                    the user clicked on it, it’s going to do something. In our case, we’re going to show the category dialogue. 
                    The category dialogue is an alert dialog, a material alert dialog that we created. It’s very simple; 
                    we’ve also included a category EditText and added it to the builder. 
                    So we set builder.setView(categoryEditText). This way, when Fanny puts in a new category, 
                    we’re actually able to read it.<br><br> 

                    After she presses add, we create a new category based on whatever she wrote, 
                    and we just add it to the data. Very simple! Once that’s done, it gets added to the data and now 
                    becomes a new category. Now we can move on to the actual CategoriesAdapter because this one is a 
                    little different—it’s a little more intricate.<br><br>

                    I’m going to open that up. This is the code for the constructor: `public CategoriesAdapter(ArrayList<Category> data)`.
                    In our case, we just call it data to make it easier. An ArrayAdapter is a way to tie the data to the UI. 
                    In our case, we've created a ViewHolder (VH item). Here, we're creating a VH item—that's 
                    the UI component that we're going to attach it to. I’ll show you what the VH item is; 
                    it just has two components: a title TextView (TV) and a CardView.<br><br> 

                    The XML that goes with it is called `cell_category`. We’re going to split this to the right so you can 
                    see it clearly. It’s very simple, just two UI components: the CardView here that contains a TextView. 
                    So that's where we actually initialize it, and now we want to get the specific category and attach 
                    it to the UI. In the list of UI, when we open the project, there are eight boxes with text. 
                    This is where we actually get that.<br><br>

                    The first thing we do is get the current data. Whichever one we're supposed to get is done 
                    through here in the `onBindViewHolder` method. The easiest way to do it is: 
                    `Category category = data.get(position);` So the current position that we’re at. 
                    This is a list of colors that we've added, as you remember from the final project—there are 
                    different colors for each little box.<br><br> 

                    Again, we just did a random thing to get the colors; there’s no complex algorithm—it's 
                    just randomly selected color from here. We call it through here to get a random number. 
                    You can change the colors that you want. I'll show you that later, but for now, we’re going 
                    to finalize the `onBindViewHolder` method.<br><br>

                    The next thing we do is in the title TextView: we’re going to set the text. 
                    The text will be what the title of the category is. Remember that the category only has one variable,
                    which is title, and that’s how we get it. We get the title and set the text to it.<br><br> 

                    Next, we’re going to set the card background color to be `colors.random()`, using a random index 
                    from the list of colors we have. I’m going to skip this for now and we’ll come back to it after 
                    I explain this section of the code.<br><br> 

                    We created an onClickListener for the CardView, so if we want to remove the category, 
                    it calls the `removeCategory` function. The `removeCategory` function is another alert dialog. 
                    This time it doesn’t have any EditText—it's just an alert dialog with a yes or no option. 
                    If the user clicks yes, then we’re going to remove the current data at our position from the 
                    ArrayList of data. We’ll also notify the ArrayAdapter that we did this so it can update the UI with 
                    `notifyItemRemoved(position)`. This updates the UI so that the user can see the changes they’ve made.<br><br>

                    Now we can go back to the regular setOnClickListener. What we want to do here is create an intent for 
                    the QuoteActivity because that's the activity we want to open. After they click the category, we want 
                    to show them all the quotes for that category.<br><br> 

                    Another thing we’re going to do is put an extra in the intent. This is the data that the category 
                    will be able to listen to and get. Lastly, we start the activity with this intent and the data, 
                    which means we can now open the QuoteActivity.<br><br>

                    I’m just going to close some of these files and we’re going to start from the beginning. 
                    The QuoteActivity has six UI components: a category TextView (that’s going to be populated by the 
                    data sent from the intent from the MainActivity), two EditTexts (quoteEditText and sourceEditText), 
                    and three buttons.<br><br> 

                    The new button is supposed to do two things: it’s supposed to allow the user to add a new quote. 
                    The other button is for editing the quote, and the delete button is for deleting the quote. 
                    We also have two variables: an ArrayList of Quote called quotes, and an int position to keep 
                    track of the quote we’re working with.<br><br>

                    The next thing we did was initialize our ArrayList and set up our UI components, 
                    attaching them to the actual XML with the correct IDs. We’ve got to make sure that the 
                    IDs match; otherwise, it’s not going to run—it’s not going to work. The next thing we actually did 
                    was disable the EditTexts. We don’t want them to make any changes.<br><br>

                    We have to add a setOnClickListener for the new quote button and an onLongClickListener for it. 
                    We’re going to go over the function of the new quote button. When you click on the new quote button, 
                    it’s going to show them a new quote, and that’s done through the setQuote method.<br><br> 

                    We’re going to go and see what that is. The setQuote method takes a Quote and sets the 
                    category TextView to `setText(quote.getCategory())`. Then the quoteEditText is set to `quote.getQuote()`,
                    and the sourceEditText is set to `quote.getSource()`.<br><br> 

                    Now, if you remember, here we called the function `getQuote` instead of `setQuote`, 
                    so getQuote returns a Quote. We’re going to go over what getQuote is.<br><br> 

                    We create a temporary Quote here; we didn’t give it any value. We check if 
                    `quotes.size() == 1`. If it only equals one, we just return `quotes.get(0)`. 
                    The reason for this is because quotes will never be less than one; it can always be greater than one. 
                    If it's one, we return the first quote, which would be `quotes.get(0)`.<br><br> 

                    If there’s more than one quote, we just randomize and set the position to be random so we can keep 
                    track of which quote we’re going to serve. Then we set the tempQuote to `quotes.get(random)`, 
                    and we’re going to return that quote, which will be displayed to the user.<br><br>

                    Now I will actually go over the Quote object so we can have a better understanding of what 
                    the Quote object does. The Quote has three components: a category, a quote, and a source. 
                    Very simple. We need a category so we can keep track of what it belongs to. Does it belong to anger, 
                    loneliness, wealth? What does it belong to? The quote is what the text of the quote is, and the 
                    source is whoever shared the quote with people.<br><br> 

                    We actually don’t use the setter methods; these are auto-generated. 
                    You can delete them or keep them in case you end up using them. Now we are actually going to go to 
                    the new quote’s onLongClickListener. If the user holds the new quote button for a while, 
                    it’s going to show the add quote dialogue, where they can actually add a new quote.<br><br>

                    Add two; they can actually add a new quote, not two quotes, just a new quote. 
                    So, we're going to go to the short quote add quote dialogue. 
                    It's again going to be a new material alert dialog builder, and it's going to be slightly different 
                    from the new category dialogue that we created in the main activity since we want to add two edit texts.<br><br> 

                    The alert dialog doesn't allow for two views to be added. The way we were able to handle this 
                    was actually by just adding a linear layout as the set view in this method here. 
                    So, we created a new layout and set the view here because it can only have one view. 
                    That being said, the linear layout can have multiple child views, and that's what we did.
                    We set the orientation to vertical; we want them to stack up on top of each other.<br><br> 

                    We created two edit texts and added them to the linear layout. We added the hint, 
                    and we did `builder.setView(linearLayout)`, so it still technically is considered just one view. 
                    This way, we can actually have both edit texts. Then, we call the function, so if the user does decide 
                    to actually add the quote, we call the function `addNewQuote` and get the quote edit text and the 
                    source edit text.<br><br>

                    Now we're going to go over the `addNewQuote` function. So, `addNewQuote` takes the message and the 
                    source, creates a new quote, and takes the category from the edit category text view, 
                    which is actually from the array adapter. So when they clicked on the category they wanted to see, 
                    we got that information and set it up into the category text view.<br><br> 

                    Now, we're checking if the quotes array list can never be less than one. We check if it's one and 
                    if at the index of zero, which would be the first quote, we check if it's empty. If it's empty, 
                    then we set the quote at index zero to be this new quote here. If it's not empty, 
                    that means there's an actual quote there; then we just add it to the array list and append it. 
                    Now it becomes a size of two here, it stays as size one here, and it becomes size two.<br><br>

                    Now, the next button we're actually going to talk about is the edit button. 
                    The edit button has a little bit longer logic. I'm just going to go over it quickly. 
                    If `editButton.getText().toString().equals("Save")`, that means if they already pressed edit and it 
                    turns to save, it's going to execute this block. For now, we're just going to go over what 
                    will actually happen if they just click edit for the first time.<br><br> 

                    It's going to allow editing to happen, so it's going to enable editing to true and set the text to save. 
                    So, `enableEditing` I will show you what that means; it just turns quote edit text and source edit 
                    text to be enabled based on this boolean value here. In that case, it's going to be true, 
                    so now they can actually edit the quote. Once they're ready to save, it's going to check here that 
                    says yes, the text is save.<br><br> 

                    The first thing it's going to do is change it back to edit. It's going to create a new quote based 
                    on the category text view, getting the text to string for whatever the quote is that they've 
                    updated and the source. So once again, we're going to check if the quotes size is one. If it is, 
                    just like earlier, we're going to set the quote at index zero to be the new quote that 
                    we just created here. Otherwise, we're going to find the position, which is why we have this 
                    position here, because once we got the quote, it gave us the position, 
                    and we saved it as a position from the random number.<br><br> 

                    Now we're going to update the quote at this position to the new quote that we just edited, and lastly, 
                    we disable editing. So, in `enableEditing`, we pass the value of false.<br><br>

                    Then we have the delete button. The delete button has its own set on click listener 
                    and calls the show delete dialogue. The show delete dialogue is going to be another 
                    alert dialogue, and it's very simple. Once you click delete, we want to make sure they actually want 
                    to delete. We go to the delete quote function and call it.<br><br>

                    The delete quote function is right here. The first thing we do is check if the size is one. 
                    That means there's only one quote. We remove the quote at index zero. We can actually set that; 
                    that's something I just realized. We could do `setQuote` instead of `setAtIndex` and then 
                    add whatever quote. For now, what we did here was that we removed it, then we created a new empty 
                    quote and added it to the array list of quotes. That's why the size is never zero, really; 
                    it's part of the reason why.<br><br>

                    The quote function we went over earlier ensures that if the size is greater than one, 
                    we just find the quote at the current position from `getQuote` and remove it. 
                    Then we just set a new quote, so a new random quote is going to be set so the user can see a quote. 
                    That's what `deleteQuote` does.<br><br>

                    Now, as we are on this `deleteQuote` function, I'll explain why it never turns to zero. 
                    There are two reasons for this. The first one is that we want the user to be able to easily add a 
                    quote when there's not one. So that means if there are no quotes, they can just go to the edit text,
                    press edit, and start typing.<br><br> 

                    The second reason, which is actually the biggest reason, is because when I was building this project, 
                    I ended up putting myself in a pigeonhole with the code. If I wanted to make sure that the quotes' size 
                    would be equal to zero, I would have to refactor the code, which would add more time to it. 
                    So, I decided not to do that. This function works properly, and the user doesn't really know that 
                    there's still an empty quote. They don't really care; they just want to use it.<br><br> 

                    I would advise you, as you do this project, to find a way to have the array list of quotes be empty 
                    so you don't have to have a size of one all the time. You can refactor that and do that to improve 
                    the code itself. That being said, you don't necessarily have to.<br><br>

                    Now that I'm talking about this, I do think there's an area where this would create an issue. 
                    If the user, when there are no quotes, instead of editing the empty quote, decides to long press 
                    the new quote and add a new quote, that would create an issue. So, that's actually a bug I just 
                    realized while filming this right now.<br><br> 

                    That would be a reason why you want to refactor it. When I was building this, I ran into some different bugs
                    that I fixed, and that was one of the solutions. But now that we're going over the logic, 
                    it turns out this is another bug too. And that's the beauty of programming: you can find bugs 
                    until you didn't realize it.<br><br>

                    We are almost done with the building. It's a very simple project. Everything is pretty simple about it. 
                    The next thing we're actually going to do is, because I spoke about the category text view, 
                    when we get the text, whenever we get a quote, we set a quote. The way we actually get this is by 
                    calling `Intent intent = getIntent();`, so it's calling for the intent that was created when this 
                    activity was created.<br><br> 

                    That was when, if you remember, in our array adapter, we did `context.startActivity(intent);` 
                    with the extras. This is where it gets called. This is where we catch that intent, 
                    and here we actually get the string with `getStringExtra()`; that's where we get the actual value. 
                    So, that becomes the category with `intent.getStringExtra("category")`.<br><br> 

                    It has to be the exact same, so we have to use the exact name. If it's lowercase, 
                    you have to make sure it's lowercase; if it's uppercase in programming, based on your experience, 
                    if you're not new to programming, then you know everything is case sensitive. 
                    If you are new to programming and this is your first video pertaining to programming, 
                    then everything is very case sensitive when it comes to programming. So, make sure that everything 
                    is done properly with the case.<br><br>

                    Now, what we are doing here is to populate the quotes array list. The first thing we do is check 
                    if the category is not null, so that means there's a value. We create a switch statement 
                    for the category. We find the case; for instance, 
                    we can have anxiety, loneliness, anger, depression, being broke, or happy. If the case is anxiety, 
                    for example, then we're going to call the function `addAnxietyQuotes()`, and then we're going to 
                    call `setQuote()`.<br><br> 

                    The `addAnxietyQuotes` function populates the quotes array list with these quotes, 
                    so it's five quotes about anxiety. Once it does that, it calls the `setQuote` function, 
                    which just finds a random quote from the anxiety quotes array list. The same thing applies for 
                    loneliness and happiness; it’s just hardcoded.<br><br>

                    That's essentially the bulk of the project. It was very simple; I believe it took less than 30 minutes 
                    to film the logic behind it. I'm going to go over some details that you may want to know about. 
                    For example, you see here there's a yellow underline below "save." If you're on a Mac, 
                    you press Option and then press Enter. What you can do is actually extract a string resource. 
                    The reason why you would want to do this is because it's easier to change text if it's all in one area. 
                    So, for example, if we want to change "save" to "saved," we just add a "d."<br><br> 

                    like if we have a bunch of those texts throughout a project, we'll have to manually do it. 
                    If we do this and put it as a string resource, then we just have to change it in one place, 
                    which is going to be on the left side in the strings file. Here, you see it says "save." 
                    If we just want to change it, we can update every single string throughout the project.<br><br>

                    Another added benefit, which I believe is the reason why they want us to do this and why 
                    Android Studio scolds us, is because of translation. If you're creating a project for a global audience, 
                    then you will want to do this. You will be able to create different locales, I believe, is the word for it. 
                    Yes, that’s what they use here. So, if you want to add Spanish, it will automatically update the 
                    language based on the user's phone settings, which is very beneficial for your users if they speak 
                    a different language from what you coded in. Again, it adds the benefit that you don’t have to 
                    implement logic inside your project to figure out what language you're using; it just automatically 
                    does it for each and every string that uses the actual string resource.<br><br>

                    So, that's the added benefit. Another detail that I will mention here is when we created this 
                    alert dialog, we also included a style for the alert dialog theme. I'll show it to you in the themes 
                    folder here. The reason why I ended up doing this is because the positive button was not showing properly; 
                    it was white. This is the alert dialog theme. I would advise you to just copy and paste it and then 
                    change it accordingly to whatever you need. Right here, you set the negative button style to black 
                    and the positive button to red, so users know what to click. You can set it to whatever color you want.<br><br>

                    This leads to another detail: actually adding colors to your project. In your colors XML file, 
                    if you want to add a color, for example, from the top of my head, I believe gray is represented 
                    as `#303030`. So, if you want to add gray or whatever color you want, you would just do that and 
                    then specify the hex code. This way, you can use these colors throughout the project, making it 
                    easier to read. For example, if we had used hex values for colors in the categories adapter, 
                    it could have been quite confusing. Using the actual color names makes it easy to understand what 
                    it will look like. If it's wrong, you can always refer back to the colors.<br><br>

                    Again, one of the reasons to do this is so everything can be consistent throughout the project, 
                    just like with string resources. If you're using orange and end up using different hex values for 
                    orange, it can create an ugly situation. You want to avoid that, and that’s why you would want to 
                    add these elements to your XML files—your strings, your colors, and your themes.<br><br>

                    Now we’re in Section 3: Post-Building. The first question we need to answer is whether the app has 
                    been able to accomplish the goals we set out to achieve. The answer for this app is yes and no. 
                    The app comes hardcoded with values like categories and quotes, and Fanny is able to edit the quotes, 
                    add quotes, and delete quotes. That’s why I say yes; we did accomplish those goals because that 
                    was one of the primary objectives.<br><br>

                    However, the reason I said no is that there's something else beyond that, and it’s actually 
                    about saving. The app we built does not save the information that she has done, either locally 
                    or externally on some kind of server. I do think that’s frustrating—if you do some work and it 
                    just erases every single day, it’s not useful.<br><br>

                    The best way to improve that is, which leads to the next question: how can we improve it? 
                    The app has a lot of room for improvement. To be completely clear, I think it's a simple app, 
                    but there are three sections of improvement: the UI and UX, the logic (the technical aspect of the app), 
                    and lastly, communication with the customer, a.k.a. Fanny.<br><br>

                    Starting with UI and UX, I think the app logo is fine; I actually really like it. 
                    However, the main activity—the first thing the user sees—is too simple, in my opinion. 
                    I think an easy addition would be to have a text view that says, "Hey, user! Hey, Fanny! 
                    What do you need help with today?" Then she could respond, "Oh, I need help with feeling angry," 
                    and click on anger to see the quotes for that category. This would add a nice aesthetic without 
                    complicating anything.<br><br>

                    Another easy fix is the colors in the app. I believe the randomness of it is not 
                    aesthetically pleasing. While I do like the colors, the randomness can lead to situations 
                    where all tiles are red or a weird color combination. There could be an algorithm to limit duplicates, 
                    especially since there are only a limited number of colors for the categories. 
                    If there are more categories than colors, it’s understandable that there will be duplicates, 
                    but we should ensure that there are no duplicates before reaching that limit.<br><br>

                    Something further that would add more complexity to the building would be allowing the user 
                    to color coordinate their own categories. I think that's a good idea. Additionally, since we’re 
                    on the topic of color, the text color is white, which makes it difficult to read against 
                    certain backgrounds. Finding a solution to improve legibility would be greatly beneficial. 
                    There are a couple of solutions I found online, but I chose not to implement them because 
                    this project was intended to be super simple and easy for you to complete in less than one hour.<br><br>

                    Next, we look at the Quote Activity, where we see the quotes. 
                    The biggest improvement is in the UX department, particularly regarding the editing of the quotes. 
                    I think it’s very unclear how you can edit. When users click edit, it doesn't really show them what to do; 
                    it just says "edit" and "save." This is bad for user experience because they can't understand how to 
                    use it without any instructions.<br><br> 

                    You’ve seen the app in action, so you know how it works, but if someone has never seen this video
                    or hasn’t been told how to do it, they won’t be able to figure it out. One simple way to implement
                    an improvement would be to autofocus on the edit text when they press edit. 
                    This way, they know they can edit.<br><br> 

                    I don't think you can focus on two edit texts at the same time, as there's only one cursor. 
                    While this wouldn’t be a full fix, it would be a lot better because users would see the cursor and 
                    understand they can edit both the quote and the source text. Another improvement could be to 
                    highlight both fields when they press edit, making it clear that they can edit them.<br><br>

                    Another area for UX improvement is with the new quote button. It has a similar issue;
                    an easy fix would be to split it into two buttons: one for generating a new random quote and 
                    another for adding a new quote. This way, users would know exactly what each button does. 
                    Currently, the "new quote" button is confusing because clicking it could lead to the assumption 
                    that they are either going to see a new quote or add a new quote. Right now, the "new quote" 
                    button does both, but users have to long-press to access the add functionality, which isn't intuitive.<br><br>

                    That which I think makes UX the UX is that it can be poorly designed. In this case, 
                    the scenario—like this app—is not fully done. It’s a very short, simple app to build. 
                    That’s why I’m taking this section to talk about how we can improve it, 
                    because it’s something you’re going to figure out for almost all your projects. 
                    There are always going to be improvements that could be made.<br><br>

                    We’re also going to be talking about improving the logic. The biggest problem, 
                    which you can probably tell, is that nothing is saved in this app. 
                    If a user makes a change—like adding a category—once they close it, it’s gone. 
                    If they add a quote and then leave the quote activity, it’s also gone; it’s no longer saved.<br><br>

                    The way to actually make this work is to use the Room API on Android, 
                    which is essentially just an SQL database that saves locally on the phone. 
                    For example, if Fanny uses the app, she’ll actually keep the categories she’s 
                    edited and the quotes she’s added. Alternatively, it could be something saved on an external server.
                    You can create your own Node.js server—that’s what I know how to use, so that’s why I use that example. 
                    There are other frameworks you could use, like AWS or any cloud server, or you could use Firebase.
                    I’ve used Firebase, and I think it’s really quick and easy to implement.<br><br> 

                    Another thing that could definitely be improved in the app’s logic is the quote object. 
                    Currently, the quote object only has a title and nothing else; that’s all the object holds. 
                    I think it would be great to implement an array list of quote objects into the category. 
                    For example, if Fanny no longer feels angry and decides to delete the "Angry" category, 
                    it should also delete the associated list of quotes. Otherwise, those quotes will just 
                    be there without any way to access them, since the only way for her to access them is 
                    through clicking on the category. It takes up space for no reason, which I think is bad practice.<br><br>

                    I highly recommend that if you implement this, you should edit the category object 
                    to allow a list of quotes to be associated, so they can be edited and deleted. 
                    If you want access to the project file, you can get it along with all the 
                    other projects on this channel. Just click the link below in the description; 
                    you can access all of it for only a buck a month. It’s very cheap, and you can cancel anytime you want. 
                    If you just want it for this project or the previous ones and don’t want it for future projects, 
                    you can just buy it for a buck. The link is down in the description, 
                    and you should definitely check it out because you won’t have to pause, rewind, and pause again.<br><br>

                    The most important way to improve this app, though? Drum roll, please... 
                    it’s actually talking to the customer. Especially if you’re consulting, your client is the 
                    primary person you need to serve because they know what they want—or maybe they don’t fully know. 
                    You’re there to provide value and guide them to the treasure they’re seeking. 
                    If they don’t understand the differences between black and gray, you can show them. 
                    The best way to determine their needs is to ask them questions to figure out exactly what they are seeking.<br><br>

                    For example, if there’s miscommunication, it’s going to cost you a lot of time, 
                    and unfortunately, it’ll be your fault. If you build something the client doesn’t want due to 
                    miscommunication, that could cost you, so you want to avoid that. If you’re building 
                    something for yourself or your business, consider this an MVP. Once you have an MVP, 
                    spend about an hour building it, then go out to customers and ask them to use the product. 
                    This way, you can see what makes sense to the customer and what doesn’t. 
                    Then you can update it accordingly. If they tell you it’s perfect, then you know you have a winner, 
                    and all you have to do is promote it, sell it, and enjoy your profits.<br><br>

                    Now that we have this product, the next question is: how can we monetize this idea? I didn’t 
                    build this app with the intent of selling it, but it’s important to try to sell it because 
                    it builds the skill to sell, especially when you build something yourself. It’s how you
                    generate revenue, and you never know; it might be something people really enjoy. 
                    You could create a nice stream of income, and who says no to that, 
                    especially when you created something from your imagination that provides value to others? 
                    It’s an amazing feeling, and I hope you experience it. 
                    It’s truly rewarding when people pay you for something you created.<br><br> 

                    Here are some ideas I’ve come up with to monetize it. If you have any other ideas, 
                    let me know! If you want to build this product out and change it, and actually monetize it, 
                    it’s up to you. I’m not against it; it’s yours, and you can do whatever you want with it.<br><br>

                    These are the three business models I came up with rather quickly.
                    I didn’t sit down for hours thinking of ideas; these are quick ideas that I came up with, 
                    and you can implement them if you want.<br><br>

                    The first one involves selling the app as a pack of quotes for a low cost. 
                    Obviously, you’d need a good headline and a sales pitch to encourage purchases. 
                    For example, "How to Deal with the Daily Battles of Life" could be the headline,
                    and you could tell them they have a collection of quotes to inspire them throughout 
                    the day when they’re feeling down. This could be a low-cost, one-time fee option.<br><br>

                    In addition to that, you could offer premium packs of quotes. For example,
                    quotes for anxiety could be 99 cents, quotes on happiness could be 99 cents, and so on. 
                    You could even provide quotes from various sources, like Eastern or Western philosophers, 
                    the Bible, or the Quran. This could target different niches effectively.<br><br>

                    The second idea aligns more with the vision Fanny had in mind: user-generated content. 
                    This would mean allowing users to save their own quotes and content. 
                    I’m thinking this could be a premium model where users get a limited number of categories and quotes 
                    for free, and if they want more, they would pay a monthly or one-time fee. 
                    Monthly might be nicer, but you’d need to play around with the pricing strategy to find what people want.<br><br>

                    The third business model would be B2B—selling to influencers. 
                    This could generate more revenue quickly because you could approach an influencer and say, 
                    "Hey, I have this product. You need it!" This would essentially be a white-label product. 
                    You’d talk to the influencer to find out their preferences, such as specific quotes.<br><br> 

                    For example, if you were to have this as a technical tool, you could offer a cheat sheet of
                    Android development concepts for them to refer back to. 
                    This would require more coding adjustments based on the influencer’s needs, 
                    but it’s definitely doable. The influencer could then provide this to their audience 
                    for free or charge for it, which would require additional coding, possibly using the Google Play 
                    billing library or Stripe for payment processing.<br><br>

    
                    If you don’t want to handle the server aspect yourself, you can go with Google and have them manage it.
                    Just so you know, they do take 30%. Those are really the three ways I thought of to monetize this idea.
                    I would probably write some sales letters based on these three ideas to see if anyone is 
                    actually interested in purchasing them. Essentially, this is just a test, because that’s how we get better. 
                    Remember, practice makes perfect.<br><br> 

                    If you want access to the source code so you don’t have to do everything by hand, you can get access
                    to this project’s source code and all the projects on this channel for just one dollar a month. 
                    That’s a very low cost! If you want to access it, the link is in the description below.<br><br>

                    I hope you enjoyed this video! Let me know how you plan to implement this and how you’ve improved this app,
                    because it’s very basic. I’d love to see what you’ve built! Film a YouTube video or show us what it is on 
                    the Play Store. We love to see what you’ve accomplished with your imagination.<br><br>
