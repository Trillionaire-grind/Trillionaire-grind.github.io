    <h2>Discover the New…</h2>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">"Tech Mastery For Seniors Academy"</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Information is the oxygen of the modern age. It seeps through the walls topped by barbed wire, it wafts across the electrified borders”<br>
      <strong>-Ronald Reagan</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>
      Reagan said this is in the 80s...<br>
      Almost two decade before the internet became mainstream<br><br>

      Now in 2025, the internet has improved significantly and so has our access to information<br><br>

      For example, everyday YouTube gains 200,000 hours of information<br>
      It would take you 22 years, just to learn 1 day’s worth of content on YouTube…<br><br>

      Let me ask you a few questions…<br>
      Do you agree that the world is changing faster than before? <br>
      Do you agree that technology is affecting every part of modern life?<br><br>

      Although it’s great that we are getting so much information, <br>
      there’s two MASSIVE problems…<br><br>

      First Problem: You struggle to use technology <br>
      Second problem: Your grandchildren use it… alot and they are influenced by EVERYONE except you…<br><br>

      That’s why we created the “Tech Mastery For Seniors Academy” where you will learn technology from a software engineer with nearly 20 years of experience with technology<br><br>

      You see, It’s not your fault that you are struggling. You weren’t raised with technology, and you retired before the mass adoption of technology, and you never had someone to actually teach you<br><br>

      What people said about working with me:<br><br>

      “What a joy to meet Kepler Siguineau for training and tech support on smart devices. There is so much to learn, but he makes it easy and fun. With a wonderful personable demeanor, he is very easy to understand in learning the latest technology. Kepler stays up to date on the everchanging, expanding technology and brings it down to my level for comprehension. I highly recommend Kepler training and tech support.” - A happy student<br><br>

      The issue with not being able to use technology, is that you are being left behind<br>
      And it's only going to get worse…because technology keeps taking over everything!<br><br>

      unless you decide to finally learn or you will have to rely on people…<br><br>

      And you’re not that type of person right? <br><br>

      You believe in being self-reliant <br>
      And if you want to continue being self-reliant..<br><br>

      you have to learn…<br><br>

      Losing your self-reliance is only the first problem… <br>
      The second problem is your grandchildren’s safety<br><br>

      You see, unlike you, they are spending a lot of time on the internet<br>
      Like 4-8 hours a day, everyday…<br><br>

      Being influenced by everyone, except you<br><br>

      Technology can be fantastic, it can also be detrimental…<br><br>

      In fact, according to “Children’s Hospital Association” (CHA) in 2021, 2 million teens attempted suicide and 20% of high school students say that they strongly consider suicide…<br><br>

      Do you want to know why this is happening?<br>
      Well a lot of reasons for this happening…<br><br>

      Your grandchildren are constantly being told they are <br>
      Not enough and they are constantly bombarded by people that are “better” than them

      People that are better looking, more successful, more popular and they end up comparing themselves to the highlights of people they never met that make them feel like they are worthless…<br><br>

      When you went though your teens…you went through the comparison game<br>
      Like all teens do…<br><br>

      As a teen you may have compared yourself to a couple hundreds teen in your town<br>
      As a teen your grandkids are comparing themselves to millions of other teen<br><br>

      The second reason is that your grandchildren are being educated by other children…<br><br>

      Your grandchild is spending 4 hours a day on the website “Reddit", which has 70+ million people who visit that website daily<br><br>

      Reddit becomes their source of information and everyady help...

      The problem is... the majority of the people on Reddit are below the age of 20…<br>
      That means when something is going poorly in your grandchildrens’ lives, they are asking other children with no life experience for help<br><br>

      The blind leading the blind<br><br>

      There’s also a third MASSIVE PROBLEM with all of this…<br>
      Your grandchildren are being indoctrinated by the left<br><br>

      The internet is full of liberals that are promoting <br><br>

      Communism<br>
      LGBT+ <br>
      Anti-american values<br><br>

      while vilifying conservatives that want to make sure that…<br>
      America stands tall for for freedom, democracy, and capitalism <br><br>

      As you can see...learning is technology not just about you,<br>
      Or just about protecting your grandchildren<br>
      It's also about the future of this country…<br><br>

      If you don’t learn, you will lose your self-reliance,<br>
      your grandchildren will suffer, and American values will disappear <br><br>

      Now that can all change, if you decide to learn to use technology<br><br>

      You can extend your ability to be self-reliant, gain the benefits of technology, be there for your children, and your country <br><br>

      It’s easier now than ever before…<br><br>

      To stay connected with loved ones<br>
      To learn new things <br>
      To share your wisdom<br>
      To run a business<br>
      To create art<br>
      To influence the youth<br><br>

      …if you are tech savvy<br><br>

      Think about it, with billions of hours of information on the internet,<br>
      You can learn ANYTHING you want and… you can FREE yourself from distance<br><br>

      If your grandchildren live across the country, with tech you can still be there for them without putting yourself in discomfort<br><br>

      You can talk to them everyday on the internet because that’s where they are…<br><br>

      If you wanted to do that before, you would have to change your plans and travel away which feels exhausting… <br><br>

      You can be there when they are feeling like they are not enough, to remind them that they are loved and they are enough <br><br>

      Nowadays most households have two working parents, this means that most children don’t have a parent to speak to…at home<br><br>

      They need a grandparent that is only one FaceTime call away<br><br>

      It’s not only your grandchildren, it's all of America’s grandchildren that are going through this…<br><br>

      You have a lot of wisdom, and we (me and all of America’s youth) need you to share it, without it, America will disappear<br><br>

      You can help fix this by joining the <strong>“Tech Mastery For Seniors Academy”</strong><br>
      An educational program built for you <br><br>

      You might think that technology is too hard<br><br>

      Well, technology is actually easy to use. It might be hard for you to believe that now because you are struggling, and that’s why you go to a teacher…<br><br>

      If you wanted to learn a new language, you wouldn't just magically learn on your own…<br>
      You would go to someone who has mastered the language and who is a good teacher to teach you, and that’s exactly what the academy is all about<br><br>

      Now you may think that you are too old and can’t learn like children can<br>
      Fortunately for you, you are wrong about that<br><br>

      You see, your age is actually a benefit. You have built a foundation of knowledge that young children have not…<br><br>

      Here’s the secret as to why it's so “easy” for children…<br>
      They don’t care about breaking stuff to get what they want<br><br>

      If your grandchild wants to watch YouTube, they will click on everything on the device until they either find YouTube or break it<br><br>

      As an adult, you don’t do that which is good… however it's also One of the reasons you struggle with learning technology… your fear of breaking things<br><br>

      At first its an intelligent thing, however it becomes crippling because you don’t know what to do next and you get stuck<br><br>

      A kid's brilliance comes from their experience of breaking the technology…<br>
      or from learning it from someone else…just like they learn new slangs<br><br>

      you don’t have to go through the breaking phase, and you don’t have to continue to struggle…<br><br>

      You must join the “Tech Mastery For Seniors Academy”<br><br>

      You see it's not your fault you struggled, how could you not…<br><br>

      You weren’t raised with technology<br>
      You left the workplace before all of this technology<br>
      You were never taught you how to use technology, you were just expected to magically learn it<br><br>

      Our Academy is there to help you master technology, that's it, and that’s why we structured it the way described below…<br><br>

      Now you may be asking, how does the academy work and how much does it cost…<br><br>

      below you will find that answer…<br><br>

      it's a breakdown of the pieces of the way you will learn to master technology and a breakdown on the cost…<br><br>

      However it's not the final price, we bundled it up for you to save you money…<br><br>

      Our academy is structured with…<br><br>
